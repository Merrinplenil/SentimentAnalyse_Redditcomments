It was an absolute dream come true and a moment I'll never forget.\n\nMy request is because of this: while it was happening, I noticed a small group of fans nearby who were able to take photos and videos. My own picture was politely declined, so the only visual records of this memory are on their phones.\n\nIf you were part of that group, or know someone who was, I would be eternally grateful if you could share any photos or videos with me. This moment means the world to me, and having a picture would be everything.\n\nThank you so much for reading.",

I am talking poaching, stealing, abusing services, cutting in lines, argumentative behaviours, lying about minor mistakes, blaming others for their own behaviour, scamming (I don't mean it in the meme way and have met trustworthy Indian businessmen).\n\nSome pecularities have been explained to me, like in-group hiring behaviour and a tendency to stare at and pursue women. But I genuinely have no idea where this behaviour might come from. What about India causes people to act in these ways?\n\nWhy do a relatively high number (but not all) Indians engage in clearly dishonest, inconsiderate, and unsustainable behaviours in public settings.\n\nI have seen very few nationalities rise to the level that I see from Indians.\n\nThis is a genuine query.

I am in a confusion that if I go for the second role, how would be the career progression,  accepting more of a diplomatic role, is it going to hinder the future roles I could get in a company(it is a fancy title, however the learning and progression is my priority). The first role involves more learning in tech and is a common role, the second role involves more international exposure and policy making and is very unique role (since it is a unique role, it is unclear that where would I be looking forward to after next 2 years).

Two thieves broke into a house around 2 AM when only a mother and daughter were home. The father and elder sister were on a night shift. The thieves entered by breaking a window. The mother and daughter locked themselves in a room and called the police and their family. The family came back from Gurugram to Noida the same night, but the police came only at 8 AM. Until then, the thieves destroyed the house. To stay safe, the mother and daughter stayed silent and locked in.\nImpact: I am scared to leave my family alone when I have to travel for office work.\n\n2. A couple called a local electrician to repair their geyser. The husband went to the office, and the electrician started masturbating inside the washroom with the door open. When the wife confronted him, he tried to molest her.\nImpact: I now take leave even when a cylinder delivery guy comes, just to make sure someone is home.\n\n3. Even celebrities are not safe. Saif Ali Khan was attacked inside his own house. If someone with security and status can be attacked, what about normal people like us?\nImpact: I feel scared about safety even inside gated societies.\n\nOther things bother me too, school teachers trying to touch students badly, police taking bribes to hide cases or remove FIRs, bullying, increasing road rage, fake identities used to manipulate people into love and kidnapping, small arguments turning into killings, politicians filled with corruption.\n\nThen there are disturbing comments online, people openly talking about rape and murder like it‚Äôs nothing. This mentality exists around us. \n\nEven health insurance feels unreliable, in serious cases, companies try to avoid paying. It feels like whichever way you go, there‚Äôs always a trap.\n\nAll this makes me feel hopeless. Sometimes I think I should even bring a child into this world? Do I really want my future kids to face the same? Honestly, I feel like ending my family tree here.\n\nSeeing news and hearing such stories gives me chills. It feels like society is collapsing, not just in my country but across the world.\n\nHas anyone else felt the same? How do you deal with this constant fear? What steps do you take to actually feel safe at home, with strangers, and in daily life?",

I went about my days after. My money was refunded suddenly after 2 and half months which rang the alarm for me. l was travelling for more than a month and didn't doubt something like this might happen. when l noticed the money reversed in my Indian NRE account , then l checked email and some mails were there in the spam folder, no text or call communications .followed up several times with the company , they asked me to pay GST which l can claim as refund later, interest which accumulated per day for more than 2 months and go for another round of medical checkup, which l did . After a long period of waiting , got mail that policy reinstatent wasn't processed due to underwriter decision . chased them on social media , then got reply that its medical underwriter.Just after the tests with the insurance company , my company abroad did my annual physical exam which came clean though. I escalated then they told they will process this year's premium.l might go to claim for past 2 year's premium as well with the escalation matrix as it wasn't my fault or premium payment issue which triggered another round of medical tests and also l have my medical tests as well to counter that.But that part is seperate,l have lost my faith in term insurance so don't want to fight for reinstatement. I am 46 and went for that term insurance not cuz of dependents but some medical histories in my parents' side of family.Took the insurance coverage until age 80, don't know why l took it for so long with a hefty premium.shud l go for another term insurance until age 60 only or just keep investing in stocks and other assets? I have medical insurance for family abroad and in lndia .It seems keeping up with insurance companies and then claims settlement is a lot of pain and unsure that they will pay as well . its not straight forward.",

It features a vegetable salesman who is frequently referred to as a \"sabziwallah\". What specifically does this mean, and what are the associations Indians generally have with this position? Considering the subject of my paper, I would be particularly interested in the question of whether the position has any associations with muslims (the \"wallah\" half of the name seems to hint in this direction). If anyone has any relevant citeable sources on this, I would be grateful if you could post them as well.\n\nThank you!",

Are there any common \"scams\" I should be on the lookout for? What paperwork should I expect when buying the bike in the first place (pink/green slip? any special registrations?)?\n\nAnd of course, how easy/difficult is it to sell the bike off again in Mumbai at a decent price, or get it returned? \n\nWould obviously prefer to recover as much money as I can, but also not sell it off at a huge loss (even if I can just consider it a rental fee in a way). I'm fine at making a minor loss on the sale but y'know, not for nothing or worst case, just be forced to abandon the bike in Mumbai when I have to take the flight home.",

For the longest time, it meant juggling multiple apps or buying separate tickets just to make one trip across the city, which was a huge hassle.\n\nIt got me thinking about what the experience is like everywhere else. So, I wanted to ask:\n\nWhat's the one metro app you swear by in your city?\n\nWhat's the BEST feature you've seen in an app? Something that genuinely makes your commute smoother. I've heard some apps can automatically find the nearest station for you, which sounds pretty cool.\n\nWhat's the most ANNOYING thing you've dealt with? Is it a confusing design, payment failures, or a lack of customer support?\n\nAnd what's your dream feature? If you could have one thing, what would it be? For me, it would be a single ticket for a whole journey that includes buses and trains too.\n\nLooking forward to hearing what works, what doesn't, and what the perfect metro app looks like for you all!",

This means that the passport holder may have additional checks required while going to certain countries (especially in the Middle East) on certain visas.                 \nFor a non-ECR passport, you'll need an additional document like Class 10 certificate. If not available, there are other options like birth certificate (if she is over 50), ITR (if tax payer), professional degree certificate (if available) etc. You can google non-ECR documents to get the complete list.                  \nAlso, if you want your father's name to be endorsed under the spouse name field, you'll need a marriage certificate or an affidavit signed by both your parents.        \n\nThis will be treated as a name change. So, you'll have to get an affidavit done and notify through newspaper ads about the name change, if you want to change the name.            \nNote that an initial expanded to the complete form in the passport is not treated as a different name. That's normal because initials are not encouraged on passports. The extra 'a' will be the only issue for which you need to go through this rigmarole.        \nOf course, you can just renew with the existing name as long as the documents you have with that name are suitable as an address and dob proof.

If it's decreased by around 0.5 pounds, that should be sustainable depending on your overall bodyweight so stick to that diet.\n\nNote that your body will tend to compensate for lower calorie intake by reducing how much you move around, etc. So, try & exercise consistently and not remain sedentary. It's not easy and it's not going to happen in a couple of weeks. It takes 6 months or so to see good results.",

But caste is practically ignored here among urban circles unless we're talking about reservation. \n\nI don't mean to say nobody ever addresses the problem of caste or that textbooks never mention it, but given the colossal impact it has had and continues to have on the country, given all the discrimination that happens daily, and how it still permeates Indian society to its core, we have been practically silent about this- unless of course the topic is reservation. \n\nAmbedkar once said that independence for India without it having become a casteless society would only turn out to be a step towards slavery. Everyday this becomes more true.",

We have the world's most advanced academics!\"_  \n\nI know what you're going through. Before emigrating, I also suffered through years of the abusive university culture in India, where actual aptitude and interest in academia is stifled, discouraged and punished; where students are treated as inferior, subhuman, unworthy of respect by our brilliant Gurus- guiding beacons of knowledge and wisdom.  \n\nMy unsolicited advice: Take it on the chin, because that is literally the only way to get through it. It is very unfortunate, but view it as a good learning experience in your late teens and early twenties: the acceptance that sometimes things are unfair and out of your control, so best focus on things in your control. They'll never see you as someone whose concerns should even be heard, let alone addressed. The way I handled the toxic culture was by studying the uni rules and regs like a lawyer, and adhering to the letter not the spirit. Once I learned the details of what the uni staff can and can't do, it became much easier to navigate the ecosystem, recognising empty threats, and understanding when to keep quiet. The faster I get my degree, the quicker I'll be out of here.  \n\nSince I started studying abroad, I've been so happy. Academia is valued, science is appreciated, uni management _genuinely_ cares about student wellbeing, professors are actual experts and welcome discussion. Most professors prefer to be on a first name basis, appreciate constructive criticism and listen to your issues. You know, like an actual learning environment is supposed to be.",

This present one is more invasive than the last because it asks you to give details of Aadhar, electricity bill, and they also come inside your house to see what all appliances you have etc.\n\nIt seems that Siddaramaiah is asking for the survey to be reconducted because the survey he previously conducted has issues. It gives me the sense that he wants to grill the data till it gives him what he wants.\n\nMany are refusing to participate openly. There is a high court ruling that participation cannot be forced, and if you just tell the survey people that you refuse, they just make a tick and move on.\n\nIt's not such a big deal.\n\n  \nEDIT: I am no friend to 'simple' Sudha or Narayan Murthy. His empire is deeply exploitative and the societal contribution back is minuscule .  They hide behind the image of simplicity for the sake of state-level politics among other reasons.",

These folks were already highly educated and spoke English well enough to assimilate well into the local community. They came in limited numbers, so locals were never bothered. In fact, Indians were generally seen as model minority.\n\nThis is not the case now. A lot of Indians from low skilled or very rural backgrounds are immigrating generally by gaming the immigration system by using loopholes in the system or straight-up illegally immigrate into these countries. A lot of these people do not have any skills or speak English fluently. They never assimilate and create ghettos.\n\nLiterally, there are a lot of cities in canada, uk, Australia, and even in the USA. In the last 10 to 20 years, suddenly became predominantly South Asians. \n\nThis caused massive cultural change in these cities. Literally, you feel like you are in India or Pakistan.\n\nWestern culture is highly individualistic, and Westerners grew up with social freedoms. Most Western people are agnostic or atheist. Now, compare that with how rural Indian or other South asian people are. This causes culture clash.\n\n\nWhile Indians generally don't commit violent crimes, Indians and others South Asians lack any civic sense.\n\nAlso, Western countries are seeing record unemployment and house prices due to mass immigration. Indians are the largest group.\n\nWhile Indian and other South Asians also do stuff like only giving jobs to other Indians of their community like their language group or caste, etc. Same with renting their place.

And other reason is the new generation coming abroad has totally different picture of India in their mind comparing to a person living in west - when they come here to study, they find it very hard to digest that India is not that great as it was shown back home and start arguing with their colleagues and friends. This gives them a perception that Indians are not friendly and rude and are not open to assimilate.",

On the contrary, sentiment towards Indians is great and I personally share this sentiment. Indians are friendly, peaceful and often well educated. \n\nI have never been to India, but subscribing to the India subreddit I have noticed that Indians are vastly more critical of their own country and its reputation abroad than people from other countries. I guess that's a good thing, because it is a prerequisite for fixing the things that need fixing. That makes me very optimistic about India.\n\nAs a software engineer I have long felt that India has immense potential. So many great Indians shaping our industry. If I had to pick one country that is most likely to really transform itself in the next 20 years it would be India.",

India hate was already coming from some of the arab nationalist pockets of the internet for a decade now, it only really started to rise to the surface once the Russia Ukraine war started disrupting the US oil supply (and India continues to buy Russian oil, just a hint). I'm just not convinced that it was 100% organic, the same way the 2017-2022 Sinophobic wave wasn't organic.\n\nWhat also didn't help was that a lot of western content creators started experimenting ways of farming engagement from Indian internet users, which exploded after jio expansion. They found a way to draw high amounts of engagement from both Indians and non Indians, the same way engagement farming is usually done today; ragebaiting.\n\nAnd lastly western economies are also fading, the colonial well is drying up now that it has been outlawed. It has been an age old and global strategy for the rich and the ruling classes to sic their poor onto the immigrants whenever things go wrong so that they're busy being violent to whatever immigrant group instead of questioning their authority. Today is no different, a lot of Trumps narratives on Indians aren't even consistent: How are Indians low cost labour yet make more than twice the amount the average american makes on average? They'll show themselves how the ultra poor and oppressed live in India not to empathize with them but to to give themselves a reason for superiority and racism. It's their version of 'bread and circus'.\n\nThis obviously doesn't mean we shouldn't be working on our flaws, in fact that is the first thing we should be working on for ourselves more so than anyone else. But I just think that it's important to acknowledge both sides of the event just to understand how race politics work why these flareups happen from time to time.",

Too much of it really does bring down wages and raises rents. They wouldn't be happy if too many Swedes or Dutch or Finns or other ignored group came in at that pace, either.\n\nIt can also be really upsetting to find out that some newcomers- and this is not at all limited to Indians!- start gangs or bring organized crime to the country. Example: no one in Canada had ever heard of Khalistani separatists before. Now they have organized crime motivated by that. Canada always took pride that they didn't have American-style crime but they're losing that. Trudeau wasn't responsible with how many people he let in. There's simply no technology that can weed dangerous people out that quickly, if millions a year are entering.\n\nMeanwhile, in the US, the majority of scammers getting CDLs have been foreign, mostly Indian. I admit that makes India look bad, even though the ones I've ever known have been excellent people. \n\nIt's stuff like that. Some of is xenophobia and racism, sure, but a lot of it is legitimate concern. Dismissing it all as racism makes it worse, because locals in Whateverland know that what they're seeing is real. They feel lied to and insulted when they're told \"you're just racist.\" \n\nI think if countries slow down immigration and quickly deport criminals, relations would improve. Most people really are welcoming- if they weren't, immigration would be completely impossible. And plenty of Indians make an excellent impression if criminals aren't around to embarrass them.",

I have not seen a single Caucasian who knows basic things about any developing country let alone India. The looking down on someone based on their race is so natural and normal to them. The reason i believe is we Indians that have been overseas prior to 2020 were al working class people i.e people immigrated, international students or company work related people. \nThey were often either old and families or rich people who have sent their kids or scholarships holders. Now the thing is for decades we have been a soft target, people could call us names and we would just ignore. But now the things have turned. In the last 10 yrs i have seen newer generation standing up against discrimination, this is so new to the racist punks. \n\n\nYea i know all Indians traveling abroad are not the best behaved ones. \n\n\nYes i know we have a habit problem but none of them are reasons for them to hate on all of the rest of us who is not fucking situations up all the time. \n\nThis hate is coming \ncause they cant compete with us\nWe are the easiest target with the least unity as a nation \n\n\nOne might say we don‚Äôt mix with other nationals. Ie we only hang out within out own. The reason is same no one wats to be around people that look down on others and call us slurs for fun. \n\nIts high time we represent ourselves within India and overseas. \n\n\nThe issue we have back home is no accountability.

        "comment_body": "Historically, Indians have demonstrated remarkable ingenuity, offering solutions to many of their societal challenges. However, these solutions are often stifled by a small elite class that prioritizes its own power and dominance. Through deliberate obstruction, delay, and redirection of creative ideas, these elites ensure that the status quo remains intact, even if it means sacrificing the welfare of the common people.\n\nImagine a society where the once-dependent masses gain the power to challenge their rulers. The elites, fearing the loss of their control, would fight to prolong their reign, pushing the system to the brink of collapse. When it finally does, the next set of leaders inherits the blame, and the cycle repeats‚Äîdifferent faces, but the same systemic flaws.\n\nIndia, as we know it today, is largely a British construct designed to perpetuate serfdom for the higher elites. By exploiting religious sentiments and misinformation, the ruling class continues to exploit the masses, delaying any potential awakening.\n\nThose who do awaken face a stark choice: either play the same game to survive or seek a new beginning in foreign lands, chasing an \"Indian Dream 2.0.\"\n\n\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nUntil the masses awaken to this reality, the cycle will persist. The question remains: Can India break free from this colonial construct, or will it remain trapped in a system designed to serve the few at the expense of the many?\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/mtpfaqmc3gvf1.gif\n\n\\-------------------------------------",

But part of the problem is that everyone acts like Westerners are just having moral panics with their immigration waves.\n\nIt's true that wages go down and rents increase- that's why corporations want it so badly. \n\nIt's also true that there's no way to bring in millions of people suddenly without also bringing in organized crime. \n\nThe \"Sino-phobic Wave\" actually was organic, because governments and corporations alike certainly didn't want it. But the truth was, the US got fentanyl from Chinese traffickers. They often distribute it right out of family restaurants. Not to mention Zombie Meth and other things like that. Considering what fentanyl does to people, I think it's reasonable for Americans to feel angry and betrayed, especially since the media taught them for decades that Chinese people were the \"model minority.\" Then we found out some criminals just weren't being prosecuted because of this stereotype. We also have the growing problem- and we are aware this is not the civilians' fault- that the CCP has more reach than it did because of technology and lax immigration. CCP agent can easily come over and stalk members of the Chinese American community, threaten them, threaten to harm family back in China, etc. That all got handwaved as stuff and nonsense, even though it wasn't. And we can see the fentanyl addicts in the street with our own eyes, so how are you going to dismiss that? \n\nCalling it \"phobic waves\" or \"moral panics\" only makes the situation worse and people angrier. How are you going to tell a woman who discovered her teenage daughter's dead body that she's just racist when she knows the area has a problem with fentanyl traffickers? The lack of empathy is actually likely to make her racist if she wasn't before. \n\nSo instead of just calling Westerners racist, maybe listen to their concerns and think of ways you can actually help make it better. Either by supporting certain policies, being civically engaged and supporting their calls for responsibility, or heck, just being empathetic online can do wonders. Dismiss Twitterites who are spitting out foul language and cruelty but for those who have legitimate worries? Showing kindness instead of eye rolling will make them feel warmly towards you.",

And as for the way some of the Indians behave abroad whether it be exporting a whole new system of discrimination abroad in tech sectors in the US, or the way other Indians can't seem to manage their trash or their vehicles in Canada is disappointing to me as it is for many other Indians like myself. I'm not trying to handwave it and the fix has to start back here. We're trying, my family, all my friends, everyone at my workplace etc are trying our best to fix all of this and raise awareness. It's a huge task but if it isn't us then who?\n\nThe thing is that there's always something wrong with every community. Hell there's probably several issues with the white American community as well, they own a whole system that discriminates against anyone who isn't like them, and I also appreciate the pushback against those white Americans from other white Americans also that's keeping western societies so livable. The point is, why is it Indians now, Chinese 5 years ago, Mexicans 10 years ago, the Arabs 20 years ago, Italians 100 years ago etc? There's this cyclical pattern of hate that goes around where the spotlight is on a certain community for a while and that community has an extremely tough time for 5 or 10 years. Maybe they end up integrating because of it, maybe it's just that the news cycle gets bored and picks someone else. I'm not sure.\n\nWe're hearing of a 6 year old being sexually assaulted for being Indian in Ireland, a British born Sikh woman being raped and told to go 'back to her country'. It's a bit out of hand and it doesn't seem to just be on twitter. \n\nAlso going back to the sinophobia thing; it wasn't just the US though. I remember how the whole world was hating on China and Chinese people, to the extent that even northeast Indians here were copping a bit. A lot of Indians here were watching on gleefully as Chinese people were being hated on as if they couldn't even fathom that one day they too had the potential to be targeted. It wasn't justified.\n\nOnce again, to reiterate; there's two halves to the problem. I'm not trying to handwave the problems that some of our diaspora is creating. We need to have education campaigns for outbound migrants and tourists the same way the Chinese now have.",

        "comment_body": "Just by the idea of it, I can assure you it'd be a shit show but your points 1 through 5 are completely invalid. While points 6 and 7 have some logic to it on paper, I get a sense that you haven't really applied for too many visas maybe, specially in recent times. And sorry but this entitlement that because even philippines doesn't ask \"you people\" for a visa, is not a good argument to support your naivety.\n\n1. Most of the Visa Application platforms are shit. UK has a pretty good one but still far from perfect. VFS Global, the company handling this that other people have been blasting in the comments, is the same company that handles US visas as well as visas for many many other countries.\n\n2. Asking your mother's name and father's name alongwith their nationality and place of birth is absolutely not \"ridiculous\" or \"idiotic\" question. That's the basis of your being and all the visa applications I have filled have asked some variation of the same. BTW, if you are an orphan, you'd still have some sort of legal guardianship for these matters, although this is not necessarily common. Under extraordinary circumstances, special arrangements have to be made. Not to compare at all (this is a very bad example but I intend to point to the extremity), but even your pets are supposed too have a set of documents for international travel commonly referred to as pet passport. Most pet owners don't have these documents but procure the same as and when needed.\n\n3. I hate what aadhar has become in India, but didn't this point get a little too away from you here? You want to complaint about visa process or data privacy? Neither India is the only country to have this sort of national id number, nor were they asking you for your aadhar. Your passport number is applicable here in most cases or some other number depending on where you're from. In US, typically your driving license will suffice. And I am curious, what did you end up entering if not your passport number in this field that you are complaining so much? This number can lead to additional screening triggers to help investigate your visa candidature. It is not just a visa application that asks for such numbers btw, many companies ask this as part of their kyc specially when operating internationally.\n\n4. I am an atheist here. I gave up my religion like 6 yrs ago swearing I would never declare myself to be a hindu at the peak of my depression. I hate that any document asks for religion. But honestly, if any important document like a visa application does ask for it (I can't remember if any visa application has asked me this or not), I choose Hindu to avoid the risk of potentially being flagged as a case of perjury. As an atheist in India, I can tell you even though there exists a couple of judgements that make it possible for Indians to officially declare themselves as atheists, practically this is a pain to achieve. About the form, the others option is for you. The purpose of the form is not to bolster your self beliefs but to screen you. If someone asks religion, you say atheist, not no or not say anything at all. There's also agnostics btw, which I am yet to fully understand, and there are prolly thousands other religions in the world outside of the scope of any form. So be a good atheist and don't let your religion shape the conversation please.\n\n5. Most countries ask for these references. Most employers ask for such references. Does it make sense? No? Is it okay to single out India for this? I don't think so. This also depends on the type of visa, like a typical student/work visa will be satisfied with the details of your school/company. Others not as much.\n\nPoints 6 and 7 are valid but you know what if you apply to any other country's visa, the experience will be absolutely similar! \n\nI have lived in US for quite some time and lost over 50k trying to get my parents B1/B2 visa to come visit me while I was their and I never could get a visa appointment, and trust me it wasn't entirely about the appointments, but how they were presented techwise (same VFS Global). I remember thinking it's so sad that a country as great as the US cares so little about foreigners (that they literally call \"aliens\") most likely just because the foreigners don't vote for the people responsible.\n\nThe whole visa system imo is extremely stu\\*id. And we can achieve so much more theoretically as a world by having open borders but unfortunatly that's not the world we live in. India has many many problems. I assure you you will face so many problems while being here. But this rant, this is not really valid. Despite this long rant of my own, my intention was not to hate on you but to hopefully ask you to raise voice about actual real hopeful problems.",

Most of the visa application process is outsourced to 3rd party companies. The fees differ based on the country you apply from and the 3rd party that provide the visa service display this information, if you cant browse the webpage thats your problem. If you don't like the format of the website and its missing the materialistic design you see everywhere go complain to the 3rd party company. if you are looking for just the price next time try googling, because its a thing for people who are lost in Internet.\n\n2. Are you saying you cant even remember your own parents details? if you are a orphan then there is a option of NA next time try it. A country can ask any ridiculous and completely idiotic questions.. so what?\n\n3. Addhaar is not a nonsense, it has more benefits to people of India compared to other forms of card like Ration, voters card etc. Breaches.. really tell me what data doesn't get hacked... you speak as if data breaches doesn't happen to anyone in your word.. [https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/worlds-biggest-data-breaches-hacks/](https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/worlds-biggest-data-breaches-hacks/)\n\n4. If your religion Atheist is not in the list and it fall in to Other category. Nobody said Other is a religion.. Here's the definition of Other for you because you seem to think Other is a Religion.  \nOther: denoting a person or thing that is different or distinct from one already mentioned or known about.  \n\n\n5. 1st reference is from India. Every country ask this information, how will they reach you if you are lost in India.. 2nd reference is not from India rather its from your home country so they can be contacted in case of emergency. FFS if something happens to you they need to find you and inform the people who are looking for you. Basically its prevents you from crying or complaining when no one came looking for you later in case of emergencies..\n\n6. In 1-5 you complain about providing valid information and point 6 you complain about providing the information they don't need. The section clearly labels (heading) as Previous Visa and Current Valid Visa. Since you had Indian Passport you didnt need Visa. Next time read the heading as the section doesn't apply to you and stop complaining for items that apply to you.\n\n7. Based on the SampleForm thats available clearly this field is defaulted to Yes when you start a new application. So unless you change it and save it it wont change.\n\nIt takes someone exception smart! to not follow the instructions, can't read the sampleform thats created to help and come here to complain.\n\nYou exclude the part where other countries that ask for your entire life history, internet history, passwords for facebook, X, reddit, phone etc. Even after providing this information you are subjected to additional screening at borders and screening by ICE and deportation. \n\n  \nOCI is not just for frequent travellers, there are must more benefits with OCI go look it up.\n\nIndian citizen's when applying for visa for other countries  have to provide much much more information, it is fitting for rest of the world to provide the same information when they travel to India. If you don't like stay at home.\n\nVisa is a privilege and not a right! Next time take some time reading instructions on how to fill a form, it will save you lot of time.",

No western citizen has a reason to illegally overstay in India, so why ask for that info?\n\nTL;DR, Being petty is not a good choice when it comes to growing an economy",

        "comment_body": "Honestly, UK is the absolute worst of the lot. It‚Äôs not even a competition.\n\nI am an OCI, naturalized German citizen. A few years ago, I had to make a business trip to the UK from Germany. Of course I had to get a visa, despite having long term EU residency - and this was pre Brexit. \n\nSame year, I was flying back to India for the holidays and I made the terrible mistake of flying with British with a quick layover in London. I didn‚Äôt think twice while booking, but later had the thought that maybe I should check the visa conditions for transit, with the UK being the UK‚Ä¶lo and behold, they have a transit visa specifically for 3rd world plebes like us wanting to change a flight in their god forsaken country. \n\nThe worst thing is, whether you need a transit visa or not is dependent on whether your transfer is air/land side - and literally nobody will tell you if yours is one or the either. I called the airline who asked me to speak to the embassy, the embassy told me to speak to the airline, this went on for a few hours, with neither willing to definitively say how or where the transit would happen. So guess what? Not only did I pay for a fuckin transit visa, i paid extra for ‚Äúexpress‚Äù, and then did not have my passport with me the day before my flight. I barged into the local VFS to demand my passport back, stamp or no stamp, and guess what? It had already been stamped - they actually wouldn‚Äôt have informed me until after the weekend, by which time I would have lost my flight‚Ä¶ in the end, nobody even asked for my passport during the layover, so I wound up spending 300¬£ and hours of my life getting a visa I didn‚Äôt need. \n\nThis is the day I swore I won‚Äôt pay a penny more to visit this godforsaken country, and to this day, I have held that promise. \n\nWith its collective history of colonialism, imperialism and exploitation of the whole world, particularly the Indian subcontinent, you‚Äôd expect a bit more empathy from the UK and its people, but it‚Äôs the exact opposite. Their policies are increasingly populist, and borderline racist towards the brown world. And nobody gives a fuck about it.",

        "comment_body": "The US DS-160 form requires you to list your parents name, DOB, address (if living) and date of death if deceased. It doesn't ask for nationality, but since you need to enter their country of residence anyway, it basically comes to the same thing. Perhaps the saving grace here is that the form does let you mark \"unknown\" so yes, marginally better than the Indian form's design in a small way. However, I wouldn't really put the US Visa's form design above India's, given that it is a vastly longer form that asks for significantly more extraneous information than the standard Indian e-Visa.\n\nThe UK Standard Visitor Visa application similarly requires your parents details, date of birth, nationality, and even asks if they've always held the same nationality. I imagine if the answer is no, then you'd need to list all their nationalities (I'm not filling out a bogus form just to check). The form does contain a link if you don't have that information, but again, as a default it certainly requires this information. Unlike the US Visa, I will say the UK Visa is perhaps easier to fill out than the Indian form, but that's assuming we're *only* sticking to the visa application. I do want to give credit to the UK's web design, though. The [UK.gov](http://UK.gov) website system as a whole should set a global standard on how to handle front-facing web interface upgrades. The UK, like the US, requires you also to undergo its rigamarole of biometrics that India doesn't require, so its arguable which application system has a better design.\n\nEither way, my point remains. Information about your parents is something every visa application asks for. Your memory of your US and UK Visa applications when you were on an Indian passport has likely blurred with time, so you don't remember it as negatively as you do the Indian form which you just filled out. But all three countries have complex, and often ridiculous forms for standard visas. The process is much simpler for people who have expedited travel access due to individual bilateral treaties, but that doesn't mean the visa forms aren't all complex. It simply means that countries decide who is subjected to the insanity of these forms.",

There's possibly an element of that (caused, perhaps, from frustration by the sheer volume of overstayers).\n\nHowever, I don't believe there's a connection between the two issues.\n\nIndia has its own problems. The concern is not so much about overstaying but about terrorism. And that's fair enough. Questions about connections with Pakistan are not questions you'll get when applying for a Schengen visa but entirely appropriate in the Indian context.\n\nBut that doesn't explain the stupidity behind the questions asked, like asking if I previously visited India and then requiring me to provide a visa number. The assumption is that every foreign passport holder could have only visited India on a visa and that none of them could have ever possessed an Indian passport before.\n\nThat's frigging crazy. There are almost as many Indians in the UK as there are in India (well, it seems like it). And that's ignoring those in the US and elsewhere.\n\nSo there must be MILLIONS of Indian passport holders visiting India before they get their British or US or whatever passport!",

If you can understand the 'frustration' of these countries and their maliciously designed visa applications, I'm sure you can also understand the frustrations of Indians who are forced to deal with them and their resulting lack of empathy for people who hold a stronger passport. \n\nThe worst you're dealing with is bad bureaucracy. We are dealing with bad bureaucracy (when we go to get our passport issued/renewed) PLUS institutionalised racism when we apply for visas. \n\nBtw slightly off tangent but india also has an issue with people overstaying visas. There are bonafide gangs of Russian immigrants in Goa who engage in activities like drug and human trafficking. Most of them are people who have overstayed their visa or are escaping conscription due to the Ukraine war.",

        "comment_body": "Yes, its a small difference. The Indian form doesn't obligate you to provide the date of your parents death in contrast to the US form. They are both, functionally, asking for information that doesn't directly pertain to your application and is arguably obsolete. But it is standard to seek basic information about one's parents. And nationality is one such. You're simply providing your parents nationality, without needing to confirm if they are alive or dead. How is that *more* onerous? Edit to add: Your original post made a comment about orphans not knowing this information. You'd be just as screwed filling out the US form not knowing when your parents died as not knowing their nationality while filling out the Indian form.\n\n>In any case, I've extensive experience with filling applications for people to come to the UK on tourist visas, asylum applications and humanitarian visa applications (like under the Homes For Ukraine programme). There has never been a single instance where parents' nationality and place of birth were compulsory questions.\n\nMate the standard UK Tourist Visa *literally* asks for the nationality of both parents as well as their specific date of birth. And also asks for previous nationalities. The form does not let you click if they are deceased either. In contrast, the Indian visa simply asks for place of birth (and lets you fill in relatively broad responses. For instance, when I filled the form for my wife, we simply inputted the states where her parents were born.)\n\nThis is literally from the UK Gov visa application form.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jopyy9zr6avf1.png?width=1010&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e0f35143f65377c6cdb790aa0a93a28fe0202f9\n\nYou can quibble about the place of birth being a compulsory question, but the fact is, you need to provide personal details about your parents in both these visa applications. And I'm not sure how one useless nugget of information is better than the other. India wants their place of birth, while the UK wants their specific DOB, down to the year. I certainly know the former better than the latter for my own parents and my in-laws.\n\nIf you have extensive experience filling out visa applications for folks in the UK, then you should be more aware than me about this stuff. And yet you're still arguing with me.\n\nEDIT: I stand by my comment that I think you're simply frustrated by the Indian form because you just filled it out. The UK and US forms can be equally frustrating, especially since they also require you to undergo several more steps, such as biometrics, that India makes much easier. As I mentioned in my original comment, I don't think you're wrong about other aspects of the Indian visa application. The form could certainly be improved, especially in terms of its mandatory question fields and allowing for reasonable alternatives in responses.\n\nBut the form is still not notably different in terms of \"ease\" from most international visa forms. And on the bit about parents information, you're just wrong. Every visa application asks for inconvenient and seemingly idiotic levels of information about one's parents. India is not an outlier here. And the Indian e-visa application is considerably easier to fill than the US form. It is not quite as easy as the online UK form, but as I said, you cannot remove the biometric component from a visa application, which makes the UK process more onerous than the Indian, atleast IMO.",

But from the way my life is unfolding It seems like I might also need to go back there and grind for a bit before I consider any other options.¬†\n\nAnother unfortunate thing is the increasing hate towards Indians.

Just embrace the plurality of it and thank your stars that you get to love and live so many different identities. If your problem is that you cannot live out your Indian identity well in Germany and that‚Äôs important to uou, then prioritize that and see how you can travel more or live more in India. You may find that identity eventually is less important than your comfort. You may prioritize an Indian in German identity and you maybe be able to connect with Indian communities in Germany.

And then start building it line by line with the help of tools like AI, asking it what each line does and how many different ways you can approach it to optimise your code.... till you have something built that you are satisfied with.

Indians often struggle to understand that community expectations and standards are significantly higher in Western countries, as well as in places like Japan and China.",

You guys charged ahead, despite the obstacles.\n\nIn fact, you guys steamed forward so quickly you got ahead of yourselves. That's part of Modhi's problem- he has more educated people than he has high paying jobs for, hence, the huge diaspora that's been surging lately.\n\nI understand that America can't really take in as many immigrants as they say without hurting the finances of locals.  Locals have the right to look out for themselves, too. But that doesn't mean Indian people aren't hardworking or high achieving.\n\nI think India could come up with numerous visionaries that could improve the country in all respects, and probably within 20 years if it became a big area of focus.",

        "comment_body": "Your broader point is correct, OP, but in your particular case, you should be able to find a better solution for you. I am inferring from your comments that you are from an IISER, I attended one 10 years ago, when it was even less known than today, and almost all my batchmates who were interested in research got a PhD at good places abroad or in India. Over the years, I have noticed an increase in IISER's reputation, which is corroborated by students getting into higher ranked universities more often now than earlier.\n\nI am sure that you know that a PhD *pays you* (so not only do you not need to fund it, you are also getting funded), but reiterating it anyway in case it helps some other student reading this thread. You don't need an MS. The only students who needed to get a Masters were either ones who wanted to switch fields or those with bad grades. Even among people with bad grades, I know people who got a PhD in the US without needing an MS, but they had strong research backgrounds (which you seem to have from one of your comments). \n\nIf you want to do a PhD in India while supporting your family, that is harder indeed, but try to apply for the PMRF which had a decent pay and the applicants needed to have attended top ranked institutes in India, which would help your case. In fact, if you look at the fellows, you'll see your college represented well enough. Even without the PMRF, if you qualified for CSIR NET, you can get funding from the CSIR for a project at an Indian institute for up to two years which will build your profile. The salary used to be similar to an entry-level salary in other fields so you would not be taking a pay cut while doing so.\n\nI don't mean any of this to demean you or say you should be doing better. I am mainly writing because I think you have more options than you are aware of, but apologies for the assumption if I am wrong. Please reach out if I can help you with something, I'd be happy to do so.",

CAG said you could have sold them for 3000 crores each. Govt defended with points intangible benefits for the people of India.

They found irregular screening so the Supreme court suggested for planning of new methods of Monetising coal mines.\n\nThese are all saying we could have done better , not saying these are scams.

Maybe I have worded this wrong.\n\nBut my point is that Indians need to move away from the mindset of Hindu vs Muslims vs Christians vs Sikhs.\n\n (If you are denying that such thing does not exist in India they you haven't lived in India. People talk ill of other religions within their own communities and that's not good. Of course there are also people that defend other religions. I have seen Christians defend Hinduism and Hindus defending Christians too .",

India has a lot of investment done to uplift Afghanistan and that being destroyed is utterly eye watering. \n\nPakistan has not been treating Baloch, Sindhudesh, POK and Pashtuns well. Everyone in these regions knows it and they have been telling it to the government. They are sending aids to Gaza but not uplifting their own regions mentioned and depriving them of essential needs. Why are these aids not being used to improve the lives of people in Balochistan, Pashtunistan, Sindhudesh and POK? \n\nNow coming to Gaza. Gaza sheltered Hamas, and they were first to attack Israeli people who were partying. They were innocent. Israel took that massacre seriously and waged the war. What we see now is the war. Innocents always die in a war.\n\nI will rather prioritize what problem is near. Hence, Gaza is a secondary concern for me and what Pakistan is doing right now is a prime concern.\n\nNote - People suffering in both places are muslims. So don't call me Islamophobic. All rules of Ummah must apply equally.",

The Vishwa guru Glazer tribe are the ones who cannot stop themselves from enjoying genocide and ethnic cleansing. How can you hate someone so much so that you feel OK with the mass genocide?\n\nThese are the worst kind of human beings and I call them out whenever I see them or interact with one, apparently the country is filled with those kind of idiots. They have stuck their head in mud and are not willing to listen to any facts. They are not ready to debate rationally or think logically they are filled with hate. I honestly worry so much about the state of affairs in my country. \n\nAnother things these hateful politicians have done is that they have put the blame on minority for everything. They have convince the youth that eradicating of the minority and creation of Hindu rashtra will bring back India‚Äôs glory. You cannot debate with people who care about emotions more than they care about facts? it‚Äôs impossible to have a rational discussion with them. \n\nIn all, honestly, I have never understood patriotism or nationalism. I think it‚Äôs 2025 and we should get out of this tribal mentality and see ourselves as the citizens of the world. The only thing a country like India does for a citizen who pays 30% in tax is give them passport  and nothing else. Still, the youth of the country is ready to kill and fight for them and enjoying genocide for their ideas. They don‚Äôt see anything wrong with the country and consider it the best. Its honestly beyond repair. People dont loose their hate overnight. The majority mindset is of scarcity and will engage in all kind of fleecing and corruption to make more. The entire system is ruined.   \n\n\nA sign that the country is in deep shit if the biggest insults are being secular, feminist or left. \n\n\nIts the mindset of Indians. \n\nI have lived and interacted with enough people of the world and shared stories and understood that we have the worst culture when it comes to anything. The rape culture, the bribe culture. The low civic sense culture. The scarcity mindset culture. Every country has corruption. Ours is peak.

You are the one who sets the base of where that enemy operates from. British were way more brutal to our peaceful protesters than israel was. Something like jallianwalah bagh never happened there, yet we never responded the way hamas did. When atrocities only come from one side, the other side cannot justify it anymore. But if respond like Hamas, you only invite death of your people.\n\nThe worst I've seen done to the peaceful people by Israel is making them leave their homes and lands and fields, some beatings and some shootings here and there. That is also what the British did but way worse, they also did mass slaughters, enslavements, took sex slaves etc. and many more terrible things of peaceful people. Yet we did not behave like Hamas did. Both Israelis and Palestinians are evil people, there is noone good there.",

Ofcourse genocide has happened and will continue happening if the Palestinians do not become peaceful and leave this violent path. If they continue to do this, in the next 50 years there might not be a single Palestinian left. But if they become peaceful, atrocities will obviously continue for atleast next 50 years, but at the end they will have peace and their rights.

I can feel you, like we can't see our mothers in pain.\n\nMy mom literally went everywhere. Like fortis hospital, noida sector 62. Then RR( an army hospital) in Delhi.\n\nIn Fortis Drs, suggested to go for knee replacement surgery. While RR doctors suggested not to go for a knee replacement surgery in 2023. Age matters a lot in this. My mom is just 46, approximately. Later, after a lot of research. All efforts were made by my father and brother. But knee replacement wasn't an option for my mom. \nMy learning: privates are not really serious about the patient's health and age. Just trying to mint money. Not all private hospitals are doing this. But still. But definitely in my mom case. I was shocked. Nobody's suggesting anything genuine. \n\n\nLater, in Dec 2024. I just suddenly booked an appointment at AIIMS Delhi. I heard about the treatment there. Really good ortho docs are there. Hopefully, everything went so well. First visit on 22nd Jan 2025. In just 5-6 visits,  mom's operation is done. As I told you earlier, AIIMS doctors didn't suggest a replacement surgery. It was riskier , agr factor again. They suggested osteotomy ( inserted plates). Search on Google for more. Or will explain to you sometimes. my mom's niece abt to get married, so I canceled the surgery date. Later got done in last week of April.\n\nThen on 22nd April, Mom was admitted. We are both scared. But trust the doctors and process. They won't operate till the patient's reports doesn't come okay. And the reports are perfectly fine, like ECG, all blood tests, xray and MRI.\n\nAccording to department, they will refer your mom. \n\nMy mom is doing perfectly fine. Everything just so worth it. Although it took my mental peace. But worth it! \nAlso, I got some really good friends, who are senior residents there. Pursuing MS there. \n\nWill go for the right knee by next year. This year they operated left knee. That knee used to pain a lot. Definitely, you have to put effort (:\n\nAt the end, medicine won't work.

But it's definitely not nice. I get it, we were edgy when we were their age too. We've all said mean things and maybe some of us went through a phase of bullying others, punching down etc. But this is different.\n\nKids now are unafraid of their parents' authority, they're unaffected by scolding, harsh encounters, they don't care if someone tries to correct them. Social media and their peers have created an echo chamber where they feel they're always right. This level of unwillingness to change is unlike anything we've ever seen across young people. Generally, younger people are more willing to change. This doesn't seem to be the case now.\n\nKids don't understand the difference between reality and online world. It's all the same for them. Like in the book Simulacra and simulation by Jean Baudrillard, the mad cartographer's map has now become the real map for them. It's concerning, to say the least.",

Eighty crore citizens out of 140 crore still depend on government ration. If more than half the country still needs free food to survive, what kind of development are we really talking about?\n\n  \nI dont disagree with most of the things you said but I dont think 80 crore people \"depend\" on the govt ration to survive. Around 10-20 crore \"survive\" on it. But for the rest, it is mainly about providing them with food so that their money can be better utilised for education or health or other expense.\n\nEven a person earning 50,000 per month, if they come under the criteria for receiving ration in their state, can go and get free/ cheap ration.\n\n\\> The government should focus on creating real opportunities like jobs, skill development, and small business support so that people can earn their homes with dignity.\n\nI don't sympathise with the people in this case. It is the people that vote for freebies. It is the people that vote based on caste/ religion without looking at the work they will do. \n\nFree flats is also majorly given to poor people btw. Their previous generations might have encroached govt land somewhere. Those govts, inorder to save their vote bank, supported them. They have now been living in the encroached land for generations. The govt now has to provide them with alternate housing IF they plan on demolishing the encroached sections. \n\nI also have conflicting opinions in this case. People do deserve a roof over their head. That is a basic thing. So we can't really deny people free flats. \n\n\\> These endless freebies don‚Äôt help anyone in the long run. They create dependency and kill motivation. Meanwhile, the middle class quietly carries the weight of the entire system.\n\nI dont think the 50,000 per month earning dude is carrying the weight as much as someone who is earning just above 1 lakh per month, because they are also paying income tax in addition to the indirect taxes. Despite paying such high taxes, they dont get anything comparable in return. That's the general consensus I've seen on the internet.\n\nThe 50,000 per month earning dude is contributing a lot via indirect taxes, and in return, he is getting free/ cheap ration, subsidised travel on trains, EWS reservation (or the other kind of reservation) for govt stuff. But this is definitely not enough. We can and need to do more. If we can provide good quality public transport everywhere, that itself would be an amazing achievement and would help thousands of people.\n\nThis might be controversial but I want more central govt stuff in every state to COMPETE with the state govt's services so that the states do better. Simply letting states do things is letting corruption creep in and the entire country will not care about it because everyone will be like \"It is <xyz> state's problem. Not ours\". However if central govt is more directly involved as a competitor providing better services for the same/ lesser prices, the entire country would be more keen to follow the progress and try to expose corruption in those. It would also motivate the state govts to step up their service quality if they want to win elections in the future.\n\nA simple example would be police: \n\nI want a central govt directly run police stations in every district, which is run by ex-Agniveers. There we can provide proper body cams for everyone and have a professional parallel police system that is able to step in and help people when the corrupt local police fucks everyone up. Since everything is monitored 24x7 through body cams, they should be less inclined to be against people. \n\nOne more use case would be central govt run public transport system in every state competing with the local state govt buses. Atleast they can provide clean buses on more routes and would help solve our traffic woes to an extent.",

As for housing...well you need to consider the alternative...what is it exactly? Housing is kind of an essential...without stable housing, you're much less likely to be able to benefit from those other things (eduction, skill dev, etc). You also end up getting unplanned housing (ie slums) that are not great for the people living there, nor for anyone else. So, as a policy matter, I don't necessarily think that providing access to decent housing is a bad idea. I don't know how well it is done or how equitably its done though. \n\nI do agree that the wage earning middle class bears all the burden of taxation.

India is lowest taxed and most low cost of living and growing.\n\nThis question arises cause we got a corrupt govt from 1955 to nearly 2014, u expect that we will become like Shanghai overnight?\n\nMost farmers earn less than 5000 per month and suffer, while the so called middle class enjoy chat and paratha at hotels everyday, and all they do is complain. No help to needy , or rewarding their house help or so by large hikes. Just stingy and detached from reality and spoilt.",

Your enemy is not the poor.\n\nThe reason for the middle class struggle are not the people who depend on the government but rather the government itself. Poor people are not your enemy, Access to food, house and education are basic necessities every people need, providing assistance to those in need is not a wrong thing, investing on poorer parts of the population through education will give them the opportunity for a better life than they currently have, but these things don't happen overnight, they take time and also passion and dedication from the people who are taking. \n\nThese houses that they give to live are not lavish 3bhks with luxury facilities, they are basic homes. A engineer with access to a stable salary have a potency to go for a little lavish styles in building their homes. \n\nThe lack of opportunities in the job sector is because of the governments shortcomings in building up the future model of our country, (I am not in the tech world but I am only speaking from my personal experience in my field)\n\nI recently read the some report where increasing 1perct of tax on the wealthy people in India and bring in more than 20 perct of the taxes the rest of the india pays to government. But things like this won't happen as the rich enjoy tax relief benefits. It's always the middle class people who are taxed to death. \n\nSo a little kindness to people who don't have access to basic necessities is humanity. I didn't come from a super rich family, my father was a daily wage worker and he put me through education via a government school where i studied very hard to become a doctor now without spending any of my father's money and purely from merit. I am eternally grateful for both of parents. I know what's it like living from a paycheck unsure of what tomorrow brings.",

Most people have no idea what progress looks like.\nAnd to add cherry on top we have youths with a very progressive mindset, at one side they fight for jobs and on the other side they will support the same regime and then comes the genz of India, the riches barely care while the middle class ones I don't need to explain..",

It might look innocent at first, but in the background they could be the usual mass group chats to assemble at a place and someone throws a petrol bomb, the government takes the blame, someone says this \"Hindu man\" threw it because he hates Mohammad and a religious riot starts. People have done shit like this forever to incite violence and if you are running a government, you are duty-bound to look at these angles.

Luckily, he had digital proof and managed to win.\n\nBut after losing years, money, and time with his kids, he said something that stayed with me:\n‚ÄúI should have just taken dowry like most people. At least then I would have had something left for everything I‚Äôve lost.‚Äù\n\nHe didn‚Äôt mean it literally.

If they ask for dowry after marriage, you can file a case and get them arrested even without an investigation.\n\nUnderstood?\n\nWhereas a guy does not have the choice to say ‚ÄúNo‚Äù to alimony. He has to give it under court rules. Even if he found out the girl is cheating, or has a child with another man, the husband is FORCED to pay alimony for both the wife and her child with other man. He has to pay for both. The Hon‚Äôble court says so.\n\nSo all you feminists cry for something that has been spoken a million times, a law being passed to protect women from dowry harassment, to protect women from an ill fated life after divorce, etc.\n\nWhere is the law to protect men from false cases or domestic violence by wife & her family? FYI, 80% of all dowry cases are found to be fake with proofs. The remaining 20% does not have enough evidence to prove it is fake (since guilty until proven innocent, even this 20% might come down to 10-5%. So probably 90% of dowry cases might be false). Let that sink in. A few men have already ended their lives, but still no one wants to talk about this. No law has been passed even to prevent false cases let alone punish the false case filers by treating them as criminals (which they are), because they not only put an innocent‚Äôs life in danger but also lie in front of the court.\n\nBut‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. even after a women files a false case, lie in front of the court, she is set free. Oh and she is also rightfully entitled for alimony even after doing this. And she can do this to the next victim and go on a rampage destroying innocent men‚Äôs lives, while you feminists laugh at these unfortunate incidents while no real man does the same when an innocent woman faces an unfortunate fate.",

Chitpavan Brahmins score more or less the same percentage of admixture from the Middle East as other upper castes along the west coast like namboothiri Brahmins and nasrani Christians from Kerala. This was just cuz the coast was a trade hub.\n\nIt‚Äôs not exactly right to say Brahmins are not indigenous to India. They definitely have more share of ancestory from the steppe, but that doesn‚Äôt mean they don‚Äôt have any ‚Äúindigenous‚Äù ancestry. If you simply go by highest steppe ancestry= outsiders, then the Jats would be the ‚Äúnon indigenous‚Äù ones, not even Brahmins. Most isolated tribal populations too have traces of steppe ancestry in them cuz though they were the most recent migrants, the yamnaya people‚Äôs migration was still very long ago.\n\nHere‚Äôs a much more recent paper on this topic\n\nhttps://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6822619/\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002929718303987",

Instead of saying \"eat less rice\" or \"eat one less roti\", recommend something like \"use this multigrain atta for your rotis\" or \"instead of having all your rice with dal, have some with this curry (veggies/meat with gravy)\". The idea is that they can continue to serve themselves the same volume, but the meal becomes more balanced. They may even find themselves feeling fuller than before. Multigrain attas tend to have more fibre, and curries are heavier than dal, which would naturally encourage them to eat smaller portions. Of course, this isn't foolproof. But once they see that something you recommended works, they may be more open to seeing a professional who can come up with a proper plan for them.\n\nEdit to add: you can also try something like using smaller plates or suggesting that they eat a salad before their usual rice/roti. But I do find that indian parents respond better when you meet them where they are instead of pushing \"western fad diets\" on them. They do much better with \"add this\" than with \"don't eat this\".",

Nothing unfamiliar is added, nothing is eliminated. \n\nBut problem is that old ideas and habits are held on strongly to.

You'll need to either have a lot of it or make it very thick for it to be useful. Both of those are tricky for older people who naturally have smaller appetites than younger people like us. I'd argue their protein needs are higher too since muscle loss comes naturally with age.\n\nStill, I do agree that dal is a source of protein especially with rice, which is why I'm not asking my parents to eliminate it. I'm just saying that instead of having 1 bowl of dal, have half a bowl of dal and let the other half be something with more protein per unit volume.",

E2EE is useless if a cop can just slap you and take your phone to read your texts, but it's the bare minimum expected of an app in 2025. Indian govt wants to spy on VPN users as well which is why Proton has been having a hard time recently. They'll keep invading our privacy in the name of security which the Supreme Court has confirmed is our right, and there's nothing we can do. The least you can do is not send your chats directly to some semi educated fool behind a desk who thinks dissing the govt in power is dissing Bharat mata (ki jai). I don't even talk politics much in chats, but I do expect what I say to not go directly to Modi.\n\nNow that the founder is completely and wholly in bed with the govt in power, I'd prefer to be skeptical until it's completely fleshed out. I also think giving our govt emails to a private entity is a very slippery slope and shouldn't have been done, unless it was only Gmail and other emails being routed.",

Sea water cooling in data centers, especially in coastal or underwater locations is an established and proven technology. Google's own Hamina datacentre in Finland is an example.\n\nThis approach often uses sea water in a closed loop system, where sea water flows through a heat exchanger to cool fresh water circulating within the data center cooling system. This method significantly reduces the energy required for mechanical chillers and eliminates fresh water consumption. \n\nThermal power plants located on the coast have been using this cooling technique for decades. In fact, the [Simhadri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simhadri_Super_Thermal_Power_Station) power plant located next door in Visakhapatnam uses this very technique of cooling, using seawater pumped in from the¬†Bay of Bengal.

They are ones who don‚Äôt teach and slide away from these charges by their influence. Poor fellows who are very punctual in their teaching work have to do this. \n\nNo government cares about students as they are not voters. Until these people become eligible voters they forget about these.",

I have met amazing teachers too. Private schools just focus on results so that their business run, government teachers have been children second parents. Now a days government schools get students who has no basic needs or single parents or parents who are drunkards. For such students they are the guardian and they are doing amazing jobs apart from teaching. \n\nThis is not the first time they are doing, but this is the first time where government lacks empathy and thinks that government employees are their slaves. \nNobody gets their pain unless they see it with their family members. They have been doing hell lot of other works with their teaching tasks. Our personal bias should not make us blind for somebody‚Äôs suffering. Yes some teachers maynot have taught well and was lazy, but that should not justify the torture by government.",

Plagiarism is at an epic level when we were going through their research paper. Hence I commented like that.",
