1n5ibw7,Ask India Thread,nbszzop,"Hi everyone,

I'm sharing a once-in-a-lifetime experience from the concert weekend and have a heartfelt request for the community.

I was lucky enough to have a brief, kind interaction with Chris Martin after the show where he signed an item for me. It was an absolute dream come true and a moment I'll never forget.

My request is because of this: while it was happening, I noticed a small group of fans nearby who were able to take photos and videos. My own picture was politely declined, so the only visual records of this memory are on their phones.

If you were part of that group, or know someone who was, I would be eternally grateful if you could share any photos or videos with me. This moment means the world to me, and having a picture would be everything.

Thank you so much for reading.",3,Positive

Pardon the bluntness. I have met many Indians who do not fit the following description.

Why is lying (even about mundane and unimportant things) and a poor civic sense so common among the recent waves of immigrants we have been getting? I am talking poaching, stealing, abusing services, cutting in lines, argumentative behaviours, lying about minor mistakes, blaming others for their own behaviour, scamming (I don't mean it in the meme way and have met trustworthy Indian businessmen).

Some pecularities have been explained to me, like in-group hiring behaviour and a tendency to stare at and pursue women. But I genuinely have no idea where this behaviour might come from. What about India causes people to act in these ways?

Why do a relatively high number (but not all) Indians engage in clearly dishonest, inconsiderate, and unsustainable behaviours in public settings.

I have seen very few nationalities rise to the level that I see from Indians.

This is a genuine query. I apologize if it offends you. I am talking about the behavioural patterns that I see. I am not saying that you fit that pattern.",2,Negative

Recently a few incidents really shook me:

1. Two thieves broke into a house around 2 AM when only a mother and daughter were home. The father and elder sister were on a night shift. The thieves entered by breaking a window. The mother and daughter locked themselves in a room and called the police and their family. The family came back from Gurugram to Noida the same night, but the police came only at 8 AM. Until then, the thieves destroyed the house. To stay safe, the mother and daughter stayed silent and locked in.
Impact: I am scared to leave my family alone when I have to travel for office work.

2. A couple called a local electrician to repair their geyser. The husband went to the office, and the electrician started masturbating inside the washroom with the door open. When the wife confronted him, he tried to molest her.
Impact: I now take leave even when a cylinder delivery guy comes, just to make sure someone is home.

3. Even celebrities are not safe. Saif Ali Khan was attacked inside his own house. If someone with security and status can be attacked, what about normal people like us?
Impact: I feel scared about safety even inside gated societies.

Other things bother me too, school teachers trying to touch students badly, police taking bribes to hide cases or remove FIRs, bullying, increasing road rage, fake identities used to manipulate people into love and kidnapping, small arguments turning into killings, politicians filled with corruption.

Then there are disturbing comments online, people openly talking about rape and murder like it‚Äôs nothing. This mentality exists around us. 

Even health insurance feels unreliable, in serious cases, companies try to avoid paying. It feels like whichever way you go, there‚Äôs always a trap.

All this makes me feel hopeless. Sometimes I think I should even bring a child into this world? Do I really want my future kids to face the same? Honestly, I feel like ending my family tree here.

Seeing news and hearing such stories gives me chills. It feels like society is collapsing, not just in my country but across the world.

I‚Äôm planning to spend 3 to 4 months in India starting in January.  
My plan is to start in the North and make my way down to the South, letting the journey be guided by the people I meet, my interests, and the opportunities along the way.

I‚Äôd like to know which city is best to start from in the North. Since I‚Äôll be flying from France, I‚Äôll probably land in New Delhi. Would it be worth going up to the Himachal Pradesh or Chandigarh region to begin the trip?

Here in Mumbai, for instance, you have different companies running different metro lines. For the longest time, it meant juggling multiple apps or buying separate tickets just to make one trip across the city, which was a huge hassle.

It got me thinking about what the experience is like everywhere else. So, I wanted to ask:

What's the one metro app you swear by in your city?

What's the BEST feature you've seen in an app? Something that genuinely makes your commute smoother. I've heard some apps can automatically find the nearest station for you, which sounds pretty cool.

What's the most ANNOYING thing you've dealt with? Is it a confusing design, payment failures, or a lack of customer support?

And what's your dream feature? If you could have one thing, what would it be? For me, it would be a single ticket for a whole journey that includes buses and trains too.

Looking forward to hearing what works, what doesn't, and what the perfect metro app looks like for you all!",1,Positive

Then measure your weight in a month. If your weight has increased, reduce what you eat. If it's decreased by around 0.5 pounds, that should be sustainable depending on your overall bodyweight so stick to that diet.

Note that your body will tend to compensate for lower calorie intake by reducing how much you move around, etc. So, try & exercise consistently and not remain sedentary. It's not easy and it's not going to happen in a couple of weeks. It takes 6 months or so to see good results.",1,Negative

Then by that case you also didn't do anything special be being born a particular caste
If you bring 2000 year old history

I know what you're going through. Before emigrating, I also suffered through years of the abusive university culture in India, where actual aptitude and interest in academia is stifled, discouraged and punished; where students are treated as inferior, subhuman, unworthy of respect by our brilliant Gurus- guiding beacons of knowledge and wisdom.  

My unsolicited advice: Take it on the chin, because that is literally the only way to get through it. It is very unfortunate, but view it as a good learning experience in your late teens and early twenties: the acceptance that sometimes things are unfair and out of your control, so best focus on things in your control. They'll never see you as someone whose concerns should even be heard, let alone addressed. The way I handled the toxic culture was by studying the uni rules and regs like a lawyer, and adhering to the letter not the spirit. Once I learned the details of what the uni staff can and can't do, it became much easier to navigate the ecosystem, recognising empty threats, and understanding when to keep quiet. The faster I get my degree, the quicker I'll be out of here.  

Since I started studying abroad, I've been so happy. Academia is valued, science is appreciated, uni management _genuinely_ cares about student wellbeing, professors are actual experts and welcome discussion. Most professors prefer to be on a first name basis, appreciate constructive criticism and listen to your issues. You know, like an actual learning environment is supposed to be.",10,Positive

It seems that Siddaramaiah is asking for the survey to be reconducted because the survey he previously conducted has issues. It gives me the sense that he wants to grill the data till it gives him what he wants.

Many are refusing to participate openly. There is a high court ruling that participation cannot be forced, and if you just tell the survey people that you refuse, they just make a tick and move on.

Extreme communalism, regionalism, casteism, corruption will be the end of this country. Another major reason is a sheer lack of empathy which then ultimately further translates into, or propagates other issues. 

For example, Indians don't bother about fixing anything unless it starts affecting them directly. This attitude is present through all classes of Indian society. Basically, ""apna kaam banta, bhaad mein jaaye janta"". 

They have a habit of fixing things only on paper or just in name only- this practice is also prevalent in corporates and all the way to the government elected by the people. On paper we might be the 4th biggest economy and all that, but the ground reality of this country doesn't look like that of a 4th largest economy.

1o81623,Why I believe Anti-India Sentiment is Rising.,njsi2vm,"It is mainly due to the sheer scale of mass immigration of Indians into Western countries.

Unlike in the past, generally wealthy or highly skilled Indians were able to immigrate. These folks were already highly educated and spoke English well enough to assimilate well into the local community. They came in limited numbers, so locals were never bothered. In fact, Indians were generally seen as model minority.

This is not the case now. A lot of Indians from low skilled or very rural backgrounds are immigrating generally by gaming the immigration system by using loopholes in the system or straight-up illegally immigrate into these countries. A lot of these people do not have any skills or speak English fluently. They never assimilate and create ghettos.

Literally, there are a lot of cities in canada, uk, Australia, and even in the USA. In the last 10 to 20 years, suddenly became predominantly South Asians. 

This caused massive cultural change in these cities. Literally, you feel like you are in India or Pakistan.

Western culture is highly individualistic, and Westerners grew up with social freedoms. Most Western people are agnostic or atheist. Now, compare that with how rural Indian or other South asian people are. This causes culture clash.


While Indians generally don't commit violent crimes, Indians and others South Asians lack any civic sense.

Also, Western countries are seeing record unemployment and house prices due to mass immigration. Indians are the largest group.

While Indian and other South Asians also do stuff like only giving jobs to other Indians of their community like their language group or caste, etc. Same with renting their place. All these irks them.",4,Positive

For example majority articles are like - why indian youth leaving India? - Just normally see what western media says about India. And other reason is the new generation coming abroad has totally different picture of India in their mind comparing to a person living in west - when they come here to study, they find it very hard to digest that India is not that great as it was shown back home and start arguing with their colleagues and friends.

I have never been to India, but subscribing to the India subreddit I have noticed that Indians are vastly more critical of their own country and its reputation abroad than people from other countries. I guess that's a good thing, because it is a prerequisite for fixing the things that need fixing. That makes me very optimistic about India.

1o81623,Why I believe Anti-India Sentiment is Rising.,njroi0g,"Half of it is all the social ills that exist here. The other half is that it's an orchestrated campaign. India hate was already coming from some of the arab nationalist pockets of the internet for a decade now, it only really started to rise to the surface once the Russia Ukraine war started disrupting the US oil supply (and India continues to buy Russian oil, just a hint). I'm just not convinced that it was 100% organic, the same way the 2017-2022 Sinophobic wave wasn't organic.

What also didn't help was that a lot of western content creators started experimenting ways of farming engagement from Indian internet users, which exploded after jio expansion. They found a way to draw high amounts of engagement from both Indians and non Indians, the same way engagement farming is usually done today; ragebaiting.

And lastly western economies are also fading, the colonial well is drying up now that it has been outlawed. It has been an age old and global strategy for the rich and the ruling classes to sic their poor onto the immigrants whenever things go wrong so that they're busy being violent to whatever immigrant group instead of questioning their authority. Today is no different, a lot of Trumps narratives on Indians aren't even consistent: How are Indians low cost labour yet make more than twice the amount the average american makes on average? They'll show themselves how the ultra poor and oppressed live in India not to empathize with them but to to give themselves a reason for superiority and racism. It's their version of 'bread and circus'.

This obviously doesn't mean we shouldn't be working on our flaws, in fact that is the first thing we should be working on for ourselves more so than anyone else. But I just think that it's important to acknowledge both sides of the event just to understand how race politics work why these flareups happen from time to time.",2,Negative
1o81623,Why I believe Anti-India Sentiment is Rising.,njs2wwx,"Unfortunately there is a math problem- there really are only so many jobs available. So I don't think it's wrong for citizens of Whateverland to vote no more immigration. Too much of it really does bring down wages and raises rents. They wouldn't be happy if too many Swedes or Dutch or Finns or other ignored group came in at that pace, either.

It can also be really upsetting to find out that some newcomers- and this is not at all limited to Indians!- start gangs or bring organized crime to the country. Example: no one in Canada had ever heard of Khalistani separatists before. Now they have organized crime motivated by that. Canada always took pride that they didn't have American-style crime but they're losing that. Trudeau wasn't responsible with how many people he let in. There's simply no technology that can weed dangerous people out that quickly, if millions a year are entering.

Meanwhile, in the US, the majority of scammers getting CDLs have been foreign, mostly Indian. I admit that makes India look bad, even though the ones I've ever known have been excellent people. 

It's stuff like that. Some of is xenophobia and racism, sure, but a lot of it is legitimate concern. Dismissing it all as racism makes it worse, because locals in Whateverland know that what they're seeing is real. They feel lied to and insulted when they're told ""you're just racist."" 

I think if countries slow down immigration and quickly deport criminals, relations would improve. Most people really are welcoming- if they weren't, immigration would be completely impossible. And plenty of Indians make an excellent impression if criminals aren't around to embarrass them.",1,Negative
1o81623,Why I believe Anti-India Sentiment is Rising.,njro2x8,"I think, we have plenty of space in India, we haven't developed or poured infrastructure around our towns, cities.

We do certainly, and we have more space to absorb all of them, this is just my town, there are so many cities, towns all over India in a similar way.

Hope you agree?

With regarding to civic sense, this comes up regularly in conversation as recurring theme. I think, it is solvable issue, which other countries like Singapore, even US implemented, not sure about the exact details of how they did it, my point is it can be resolved.

I think, we can certainly make things better, it's just 98% of us do not have the power to push fast changes that is scalable to entire country, maybe someone can share, how to approach this, think this way, if we can implement large solutions of improving infrastructure issues like poor building, roads, congestion, following rules, respect of others \[civic-sense\], protecting public-space, this can make entire country better, everyone will benefit.

At present, lot of red-tape in govt, lack of good-work-ethic, and slow pace. Most importantly, India's political class are not much interested in solving this.

But the hate part overseas is all wrong. I have not seen a single Caucasian who knows basic things about any developing country let alone India. The looking down on someone based on their race is so natural and normal to them. The reason i believe is we Indians that have been overseas prior to 2020 were al working class people i.e people immigrated, international students or company work related people. 
They were often either old and families or rich people who have sent their kids or scholarships holders. Now the thing is for decades we have been a soft target, people could call us names and we would just ignore. But now the things have turned. In the last 10 yrs i have seen newer generation standing up against discrimination, this is so new to the racist punks. 


Yea i know all Indians traveling abroad are not the best behaved ones. 


Yes i know we have a habit problem but none of them are reasons for them to hate on all of the rest of us who is not fucking situations up all the time.

cause they cant compete with us
We are the easiest target with the least unity as a nation 


One might say we don‚Äôt mix with other nationals. Ie we only hang out within out own. The reason is same no one wats to be around people that look down on others and call us slurs for fun.

1o81623,Why I believe Anti-India Sentiment is Rising.,njrp4hj,"Historically, Indians have demonstrated remarkable ingenuity, offering solutions to many of their societal challenges. However, these solutions are often stifled by a small elite class that prioritizes its own power and dominance. Through deliberate obstruction, delay, and redirection of creative ideas, these elites ensure that the status quo remains intact, even if it means sacrificing the welfare of the common people.

Imagine a society where the once-dependent masses gain the power to challenge their rulers. The elites, fearing the loss of their control, would fight to prolong their reign, pushing the system to the brink of collapse. When it finally does, the next set of leaders inherits the blame, and the cycle repeats‚Äîdifferent faces, but the same systemic flaws.

India, as we know it today, is largely a British construct designed to perpetuate serfdom for the higher elites. By exploiting religious sentiments and misinformation, the ruling class continues to exploit the masses, delaying any potential awakening.

Those who do awaken face a stark choice: either play the same game to survive or seek a new beginning in foreign lands, chasing an ""Indian Dream 2.0.""



**Conclusion:**

Until the masses awaken to this reality, the cycle will persist. The question remains: Can India break free from this colonial construct, or will it remain trapped in a system designed to serve the few at the expense of the many?

1o81623,Why I believe Anti-India Sentiment is Rising.,njs7hum,"I'm not going to downvote you, but I think some of this is copium. India can absolutely be something unlike the planet has ever seen. But part of the problem is that everyone acts like Westerners are just having moral panics with their immigration waves.

It's true that wages go down and rents increase- that's why corporations want it so badly. 

It's also true that there's no way to bring in millions of people suddenly without also bringing in organized crime. 

The ""Sino-phobic Wave"" actually was organic, because governments and corporations alike certainly didn't want it. But the truth was, the US got fentanyl from Chinese traffickers. They often distribute it right out of family restaurants. Not to mention Zombie Meth and other things like that. Considering what fentanyl does to people, I think it's reasonable for Americans to feel angry and betrayed, especially since the media taught them for decades that Chinese people were the ""model minority."" Then we found out some criminals just weren't being prosecuted because of this stereotype. We also have the growing problem- and we are aware this is not the civilians' fault- that the CCP has more reach than it did because of technology and lax immigration. CCP agent can easily come over and stalk members of the Chinese American community, threaten them, threaten to harm family back in China, etc. That all got handwaved as stuff and nonsense, even though it wasn't. And we can see the fentanyl addicts in the street with our own eyes, so how are you going to dismiss that? 

Calling it ""phobic waves"" or ""moral panics"" only makes the situation worse and people angrier. How are you going to tell a woman who discovered her teenage daughter's dead body that she's just racist when she knows the area has a problem with fentanyl traffickers? The lack of empathy is actually likely to make her racist if she wasn't before. 

So instead of just calling Westerners racist, maybe listen to their concerns and think of ways you can actually help make it better.

1o81623,Why I believe Anti-India Sentiment is Rising.,njsjdi5,"No I get what you're saying. The fentanyl thing was new to me though. And as for the way some of the Indians behave abroad whether it be exporting a whole new system of discrimination abroad in tech sectors in the US, or the way other Indians can't seem to manage their trash or their vehicles in Canada is disappointing to me as it is for many other Indians like myself. I'm not trying to handwave it and the fix has to start back here. We're trying, my family, all my friends, everyone at my workplace etc are trying our best to fix all of this and raise awareness. It's a huge task but if it isn't us then who?

The thing is that there's always something wrong with every community. Hell there's probably several issues with the white American community as well, they own a whole system that discriminates against anyone who isn't like them, and I also appreciate the pushback against those white Americans from other white Americans also that's keeping western societies so livable. The point is, why is it Indians now, Chinese 5 years ago, Mexicans 10 years ago, the Arabs 20 years ago, Italians 100 years ago etc? There's this cyclical pattern of hate that goes around where the spotlight is on a certain community for a while and that community has an extremely tough time for 5 or 10 years. Maybe they end up integrating because of it, maybe it's just that the news cycle gets bored and picks someone else. I'm not sure.

We're hearing of a 6 year old being sexually assaulted for being Indian in Ireland, a British born Sikh woman being raped and told to go 'back to her country'. It's a bit out of hand and it doesn't seem to just be on twitter. 

Also going back to the sinophobia thing; it wasn't just the US though. I remember how the whole world was hating on China and Chinese people, to the extent that even northeast Indians here were copping a bit. A lot of Indians here were watching on gleefully as Chinese people were being hated on as if they couldn't even fathom that one day they too had the potential to be targeted. It wasn't justified.

Once again, to reiterate; there's two halves to the problem. I'm not trying to handwave the problems that some of our diaspora is creating. We need to have education campaigns for outbound migrants and tourists the same way the Chinese now have.",2,Negative

While points 6 and 7 have some logic to it on paper, I get a sense that you haven't really applied for too many visas maybe, specially in recent times. And sorry but this entitlement that because even philippines doesn't ask ""you people"" for a visa, is not a good argument to support your naivety.

1. Most of the Visa Application platforms are shit. UK has a pretty good one but still far from perfect. VFS Global, the company handling this that other people have been blasting in the comments, is the same company that handles US visas as well as visas for many many other countries.

2. Asking your mother's name and father's name alongwith their nationality and place of birth is absolutely not ""ridiculous"" or ""idiotic"" question. That's the basis of your being and all the visa applications I have filled have asked some variation of the same. BTW, if you are an orphan, you'd still have some sort of legal guardianship for these matters, although this is not necessarily common. Under extraordinary circumstances, special arrangements have to be made. Not to compare at all (this is a very bad example but I intend to point to the extremity), but even your pets are supposed too have a set of documents for international travel commonly referred to as pet passport. Most pet owners don't have these documents but procure the same as and when needed.

3. I hate what aadhar has become in India, but didn't this point get a little too away from you here? You want to complaint about visa process or data privacy? Neither India is the only country to have this sort of national id number, nor were they asking you for your aadhar. Your passport number is applicable here in most cases or some other number depending on where you're from. In US, typically your driving license will suffice. And I am curious, what did you end up entering if not your passport number in this field that you are complaining so much? This number can lead to additional screening triggers to help investigate your visa candidature. It is not just a visa application that asks for such numbers btw, many companies ask this as part of their kyc specially when operating internationally.

4. I am an atheist here. I gave up my religion like 6 yrs ago swearing I would never declare myself to be a hindu at the peak of my depression. I hate that any document asks for religion. But honestly, if any important document like a visa application does ask for it (I can't remember if any visa application has asked me this or not), I choose Hindu to avoid the risk of potentially being flagged as a case of perjury. As an atheist in India, I can tell you even though there exists a couple of judgements that make it possible for Indians to officially declare themselves as atheists, practically this is a pain to achieve. About the form, the others option is for you. The purpose of the form is not to bolster your self beliefs but to screen you. If someone asks religion, you say atheist, not no or not say anything at all. There's also agnostics btw, which I am yet to fully understand, and there are prolly thousands other religions in the world outside of the scope of any form. So be a good atheist and don't let your religion shape the conversation please.

5. Most countries ask for these references. Most employers ask for such references. Does it make sense? No? Is it okay to single out India for this? I don't think so. This also depends on the type of visa, like a typical student/work visa will be satisfied with the details of your school/company. Others not as much.

Points 6 and 7 are valid but you know what if you apply to any other country's visa, the experience will be absolutely similar! 

I have lived in US for quite some time and lost over 50k trying to get my parents B1/B2 visa to come visit me while I was their and I never could get a visa appointment, and trust me it wasn't entirely about the appointments, but how they were presented techwise (same VFS Global). I remember thinking it's so sad that a country as great as the US cares so little about foreigners (that they literally call ""aliens"") most likely just because the foreigners don't vote for the people responsible.

The whole visa system imo is extremely stu\*id. And we can achieve so much more theoretically as a world by having open borders but unfortunatly that's not the world we live in. India has many many problems. I assure you you will face so many problems while being here. But this rant, this is not really valid. Despite this long rant of my own, my intention was not to hate on you but to hopefully ask you to raise voice about actual real hopeful problems.",5,Negative

Also, if you've applied for visas to SE Asia with a particular emphasis on Vietnam or Laos, their processes are just as janky with websites from the '90s if not even worse IMO with Vietnam.

Each time I have to go there for work from the US, there's a massive line in an outdated airport that puts any immigration line I've put step in to shame which you can bypass through a bribe which is solicited. Funnily enough if you stay at a 5\* hotel they simply play one of the men $10 to bypass the line and talk to an agent / fill the form for you and handle the process. I've been shaked down entering India before at the airport, but it was not as commonplace as blatant as I've experienced there.

My point on Vietnam is that it is still a burgeoning tourist destination with millions of visitors and growing.

If you don't like the format of the website and its missing the materialistic design you see everywhere go complain to the 3rd party company. if you are looking for just the price next time try googling, because its a thing for people who are lost in Internet.

2. Are you saying you cant even remember your own parents details? if you are a orphan then there is a option of NA next time try it. A country can ask any ridiculous and completely idiotic questions.. so what?

4. If your religion Atheist is not in the list and it fall in to Other category. Nobody said Other is a religion.. Here's the definition of Other for you because you seem to think Other is a Religion.  
Other: denoting a person or thing that is different or distinct from one already mentioned or known about.  


5. 1st reference is from India. Every country ask this information, how will they reach you if you are lost in India.. 2nd reference is not from India rather its from your home country so they can be contacted in case of emergency. FFS if something happens to you they need to find you and inform the people who are looking for you. Basically its prevents you from crying or complaining when no one came looking for you later in case of emergencies..

6. In 1-5 you complain about providing valid information and point 6 you complain about providing the information they don't need. The section clearly labels (heading) as Previous Visa and Current Valid Visa. Since you had Indian Passport you didnt need Visa. Next time read the heading as the section doesn't apply to you and stop complaining for items that apply to you.

7. Based on the SampleForm thats available clearly this field is defaulted to Yes when you start a new application. So unless you change it and save it it wont change.

It takes someone exception smart! to not follow the instructions, can't read the sampleform thats created to help and come here to complain.

You exclude the part where other countries that ask for your entire life history, internet history, passwords for facebook, X, reddit, phone etc. Even after providing this information you are subjected to additional screening at borders and screening by ICE and deportation. 

  
OCI is not just for frequent travellers, there are must more benefits with OCI go look it up.

Indian citizen's when applying for visa for other countries  have to provide much much more information, it is fitting for rest of the world to provide the same information when they travel to India. If you don't like stay at home.

I am an OCI, naturalized German citizen. A few years ago, I had to make a business trip to the UK from Germany. Of course I had to get a visa, despite having long term EU residency - and this was pre Brexit. 

Same year, I was flying back to India for the holidays and I made the terrible mistake of flying with British with a quick layover in London. I didn‚Äôt think twice while booking, but later had the thought that maybe I should check the visa conditions for transit, with the UK being the UK‚Ä¶lo and behold, they have a transit visa specifically for 3rd world plebes like us wanting to change a flight in their god forsaken country. 

The worst thing is, whether you need a transit visa or not is dependent on whether your transfer is air/land side - and literally nobody will tell you if yours is one or the either. I called the airline who asked me to speak to the embassy, the embassy told me to speak to the airline, this went on for a few hours, with neither willing to definitively say how or where the transit would happen. So guess what? Not only did I pay for a fuckin transit visa, i paid extra for ‚Äúexpress‚Äù, and then did not have my passport with me the day before my flight. I barged into the local VFS to demand my passport back, stamp or no stamp, and guess what? It had already been stamped - they actually wouldn‚Äôt have informed me until after the weekend, by which time I would have lost my flight‚Ä¶ in the end, nobody even asked for my passport during the layover, so I wound up spending 300¬£ and hours of my life getting a visa I didn‚Äôt need. 

This is the day I swore I won‚Äôt pay a penny more to visit this godforsaken country, and to this day, I have held that promise. 

With its collective history of colonialism, imperialism and exploitation of the whole world, particularly the Indian subcontinent, you‚Äôd expect a bit more empathy from the UK and its people, but it‚Äôs the exact opposite.

It doesn't ask for nationality, but since you need to enter their country of residence anyway, it basically comes to the same thing. Perhaps the saving grace here is that the form does let you mark ""unknown"" so yes, marginally better than the Indian form's design in a small way. However, I wouldn't really put the US Visa's form design above India's, given that it is a vastly longer form that asks for significantly more extraneous information than the standard Indian e-Visa.

The UK Standard Visitor Visa application similarly requires your parents details, date of birth, nationality, and even asks if they've always held the same nationality. I imagine if the answer is no, then you'd need to list all their nationalities (I'm not filling out a bogus form just to check). The form does contain a link if you don't have that information, but again, as a default it certainly requires this information. Unlike the US Visa, I will say the UK Visa is perhaps easier to fill out than the Indian form, but that's assuming we're *only* sticking to the visa application. I do want to give credit to the UK's web design, though. The [UK.gov](http://UK.gov) website system as a whole should set a global standard on how to handle front-facing web interface upgrades. The UK, like the US, requires you also to undergo its rigamarole of biometrics that India doesn't require, so its arguable which application system has a better design.

Either way, my point remains. Information about your parents is something every visa application asks for. Your memory of your US and UK Visa applications when you were on an Indian passport has likely blurred with time, so you don't remember it as negatively as you do the Indian form which you just filled out. But all three countries have complex, and often ridiculous forms for standard visas.

I've been in your shoes many times, so I don't need to imagine what that's like. I only recently took a British passport after many decades on an Indian one.

Do these countries design their forms maliciously. There's possibly an element of that (caused, perhaps, from frustration by the sheer volume of overstayers).

However, I don't believe there's a connection between the two issues.

India has its own problems. The concern is not so much about overstaying but about terrorism. And that's fair enough. Questions about connections with Pakistan are not questions you'll get when applying for a Schengen visa but entirely appropriate in the Indian context.

But that doesn't explain the stupidity behind the questions asked, like asking if I previously visited India and then requiring me to provide a visa number. The assumption is that every foreign passport holder could have only visited India on a visa and that none of them could have ever possessed an Indian passport before.

That's frigging crazy. There are almost as many Indians in the UK as there are in India (well, it seems like it). And that's ignoring those in the US and elsewhere.

They are both, functionally, asking for information that doesn't directly pertain to your application and is arguably obsolete. But it is standard to seek basic information about one's parents. And nationality is one such. You're simply providing your parents nationality, without needing to confirm if they are alive or dead. How is that *more* onerous? Edit to add: Your original post made a comment about orphans not knowing this information. You'd be just as screwed filling out the US form not knowing when your parents died as not knowing their nationality while filling out the Indian form.

>In any case, I've extensive experience with filling applications for people to come to the UK on tourist visas, asylum applications and humanitarian visa applications (like under the Homes For Ukraine programme).

Mate the standard UK Tourist Visa *literally* asks for the nationality of both parents as well as their specific date of birth. And also asks for previous nationalities. The form does not let you click if they are deceased either. In contrast, the Indian visa simply asks for place of birth (and lets you fill in relatively broad responses. For instance, when I filled the form for my wife, we simply inputted the states where her parents were born.)

This is literally from the UK Gov visa application form.

https://preview.redd.it/jopyy9zr6avf1.png?width=1010&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e0f35143f65377c6cdb790aa0a93a28fe0202f9

You can quibble about the place of birth being a compulsory question, but the fact is, you need to provide personal details about your parents in both these visa applications. And I'm not sure how one useless nugget of information is better than the other. India wants their place of birth, while the UK wants their specific DOB, down to the year. I certainly know the former better than the latter for my own parents and my in-laws.

If you have extensive experience filling out visa applications for folks in the UK, then you should be more aware than me about this stuff. And yet you're still arguing with me.

EDIT: I stand by my comment that I think you're simply frustrated by the Indian form because you just filled it out. The UK and US forms can be equally frustrating, especially since they also require you to undergo several more steps, such as biometrics, that India makes much easier. As I mentioned in my original comment, I don't think you're wrong about other aspects of the Indian visa application. The form could certainly be improved, especially in terms of its mandatory question fields and allowing for reasonable alternatives in responses.

But the form is still not notably different in terms of ""ease"" from most international visa forms. And on the bit about parents information, you're just wrong. Every visa application asks for inconvenient and seemingly idiotic levels of information about one's parents. India is not an outlier here. And the Indian e-visa application is considerably easier to fill than the US form. It is not quite as easy as the online UK form, but as I said, you cannot remove the biometric component from a visa application, which makes the UK process more onerous than the Indian, atleast IMO.",22,Negative

But I can‚Äôt really vibe in Bahrain either. For one I don‚Äôt know the local language, which I‚Äôm aware is my fault. But the reason I don‚Äôt is because I‚Äôve never needed it once. The place is majority Indians, most of whom are mallu. In school It was mandatory to choose Hindi (can‚Äôt speak Hindi either lol but that‚Äôs another topic). But this place is just small and boring if you don‚Äôt have some quality friends. And the job prospects are pretty bad now especially for Indians.

To be honest all I‚Äôve imagined in my life is living abroad. Either here in Bahrain or anywhere else Europe/America etc. Because It never felt like Living in India is something I could manage. But from the way my life is unfolding It seems like I might also need to go back there and grind for a bit before I consider any other options.¬†

Another unfortunate thing is the increasing hate towards Indians. Which is partly racism but partly understandable because we come in huge numbers to take the jobs of the locals in wherever. Especially the uncontrolled immigration in Canada. And overall Indians in poor areas etc getting access to internet has fucked up our reputation online. India seriously needs a good PR team. We need to do whatever Japan did to make the world forget their horrific war crimes and see them as some ultra developed Utopia that makes anime.

For those reasons even the idea of immigrating seems unappealing. I don‚Äôt wanna go over to someplace where I am unwelcome. But at the same time I also want good living conditions and opportunities. I really truly wish more than anything in the world that India was a good place. I wish Indians didn‚Äôt have a terrible reputation of being creeps or scammers.

Wish there isn‚Äôt a r\pe case every couple minutes. wish the work culture wasn‚Äôt toxic and we didn‚Äôt all have to toil our lives away from birth till death for barely a comfortable life.

We are told study will take us places - specifically related to going to IIT/BITS or atleast top NIT in CS/ECE or become a doctor (practicing - like gyne, radiology, heart or brain surgeon etc)

No one said ‚Äúdo research‚Äù. No one says take mechanical/civil or some shit like that as your first choice. No one says go into a non practicing branch if you are a doctor. You have to make money oriented choices if you want money. 

I went to top 5 engineering school in India (CS/ECE) - did well there and it does matter. When I applied for MS my Indian college, experience there and folks I met absolutely mattered. Most of Indians sitting in US are alumni from these colleges. There is a huge pipeline. Came for my MS and have been at FAANG for 13 years now. My first manager in US was from IIT 1987 batch and then PhD in US. It absolutely mattered what he saw on my resume to shortlist me for interview. 

I am originally from a tier 3 city and those local businessman and politicians type folks who used to seem rich - seem unrefined and not so rich anymore. In fact they seem downright ignorant and left behind. 

My friends who went to top IIM‚Äôs are also kicking ass. Folks spend 10-15 lakh on one business class ticket on a trans Atlantic flight, and travel with family that way - and only way to achieve that is through studies - if you were born as middle class in a tier 3 city like i was. Also screw govt jobs - my dad had one and that takes you straight to middle class lifestyle.

1o7i3pt,I think you can't go much ahead in life in India unless you're rich.,njp8u82,"Your broader point is correct, OP, but in your particular case, you should be able to find a better solution for you. I am inferring from your comments that you are from an IISER, I attended one 10 years ago, when it was even less known than today, and almost all my batchmates who were interested in research got a PhD at good places abroad or in India. Over the years, I have noticed an increase in IISER's reputation, which is corroborated by students getting into higher ranked universities more often now than earlier.

I am sure that you know that a PhD *pays you* (so not only do you not need to fund it, you are also getting funded), but reiterating it anyway in case it helps some other student reading this thread. You don't need an MS. The only students who needed to get a Masters were either ones who wanted to switch fields or those with bad grades. Even among people with bad grades, I know people who got a PhD in the US without needing an MS, but they had strong research backgrounds (which you seem to have from one of your comments). 

If you want to do a PhD in India while supporting your family, that is harder indeed, but try to apply for the PMRF which had a decent pay and the applicants needed to have attended top ranked institutes in India, which would help your case. In fact, if you look at the fellows, you'll see your college represented well enough. Even without the PMRF, if you qualified for CSIR NET, you can get funding from the CSIR for a project at an Indian institute for up to two years which will build your profile. The salary used to be similar to an entry-level salary in other fields so you would not be taking a pay cut while doing so.

I don't mean any of this to demean you or say you should be doing better. I am mainly writing because I think you have more options than you are aware of, but apologies for the assumption if I am wrong. Please reach out if I can help you with something, I'd be happy to do so.",1,Negative

Anywhere in the world, you need money to get ahead in life.

In India, colleges are ranked starting from IIT. If You do not study in top colleges your college and degree does not matter much. 

But there are locally esteemed colleges and universities. I studied in one of them (One of the top colleges in South India) We have for eg IISC and Raman Institute in Bangalore. 

Do more research into the colleges in India. 

Research jobs are not usually money making. But you could be doing research in a field which is coveted by big companies.

It's a presumptive loss not a scam... But say the Govt could have done better..  

For example :

 UPA sold 122 2G spectrum licenses for each 1,658 crores price according to 2001spectrum sales in 2008 2G Spectrum license sales.. CAG said you could have sold them for 3000 crores each. Govt defended with points intangible benefits for the people of India. It's acceptable & valid but they could have done at least 2000 crores for each license. it's our loss to monetize national resources.

CWG could have got 960 crores sponsorship contract but sold it for 375 crores. It's govt lose to monetize the big project 

The coal gate issue is a continuous failure of different governments to maximize national resources to monetize them... They found irregular screening so the Supreme court suggested for planning of new methods of Monetising coal mines.

These are all saying we could have done better , not saying these are scams. We could have improved our National wealth for the public to improve governance.

I have heard people have anti-muslim sentiments in person too. Like the other day I was talking with someone about how indians themselves are bringing hate towards indians abroad and they are like it's because Europeans support islam more. Maybe I have worded this wrong.

But my point is that Indians need to move away from the mindset of Hindu vs Muslims vs Christians vs Sikhs.

 (If you are denying that such thing does not exist in India they you haven't lived in India. People talk ill of other religions within their own communities and that's not good. Of course there are also people that defend other religions. I have seen Christians defend Hinduism and Hindus defending Christians too .",3,Negative

The way Afghans cities are being bombed by Pakistan is very painful. India has a lot of investment done to uplift Afghanistan and that being destroyed is utterly eye watering. 

Pakistan has not been treating Baloch, Sindhudesh, POK and Pashtuns well. Everyone in these regions knows it and they have been telling it to the government. They are sending aids to Gaza but not uplifting their own regions mentioned and depriving them of essential needs. Why are these aids not being used to improve the lives of people in Balochistan, Pashtunistan, Sindhudesh and POK? 

Now coming to Gaza. Gaza sheltered Hamas, and they were first to attack Israeli people who were partying. They were innocent. Israel took that massacre seriously and waged the war. What we see now is the war. Innocents always die in a war.

I will rather prioritize what problem is near. Hence, Gaza is a secondary concern for me and what Pakistan is doing right now is a prime concern.

These are the worst kind of human beings and I call them out whenever I see them or interact with one, apparently the country is filled with those kind of idiots. They have stuck their head in mud and are not willing to listen to any facts. They are not ready to debate rationally or think logically they are filled with hate. I honestly worry so much about the state of affairs in my country. 

Another things these hateful politicians have done is that they have put the blame on minority for everything. They have convince the youth that eradicating of the minority and creation of Hindu rashtra will bring back India‚Äôs glory. You cannot debate with people who care about emotions more than they care about facts? it‚Äôs impossible to have a rational discussion with them. 

In all, honestly, I have never understood patriotism or nationalism. I think it‚Äôs 2025 and we should get out of this tribal mentality and see ourselves as the citizens of the world. The only thing a country like India does for a citizen who pays 30% in tax is give them passport  and nothing else. Still, the youth of the country is ready to kill and fight for them and enjoying genocide for their ideas. They don‚Äôt see anything wrong with the country and consider it the best.

The worst I've seen done to the peaceful people by Israel is making them leave their homes and lands and fields, some beatings and some shootings here and there.

there is no clear evidence this happened. 

whereas there is evidence of Israel making false claims around Oct 7 (babies in ovens, for eg).

Ironically, there is evidence of Israel committing acts of sexual violence on Palestinians, including video, in Gaza and in their prison systems.

Ofcourse genocide has happened and will continue happening if the Palestinians do not become peaceful and leave this violent path. If they continue to do this, in the next 50 years there might not be a single Palestinian left. But if they become peaceful, atrocities will obviously continue for atleast next 50 years, but at the end they will have peace and their rights.

My mom literally went everywhere. Like fortis hospital, noida sector 62. Then RR( an army hospital) in Delhi.

In Fortis Drs, suggested to go for knee replacement surgery. While RR doctors suggested not to go for a knee replacement surgery in 2023. Age matters a lot in this. My mom is just 46, approximately. Later, after a lot of research. All efforts were made by my father and brother. But knee replacement wasn't an option for my mom. 
My learning: privates are not really serious about the patient's health and age. Just trying to mint money. Not all private hospitals are doing this. But still. But definitely in my mom case. I was shocked. Nobody's suggesting anything genuine. 


Later, in Dec 2024. I just suddenly booked an appointment at AIIMS Delhi. I heard about the treatment there. Really good ortho docs are there. Hopefully, everything went so well. First visit on 22nd Jan 2025. In just 5-6 visits,  mom's operation is done. As I told you earlier, AIIMS doctors didn't suggest a replacement surgery. It was riskier , agr factor again. They suggested osteotomy ( inserted plates). Search on Google for more. Or will explain to you sometimes. my mom's niece abt to get married, so I canceled the surgery date. Later got done in last week of April.

Then on 22nd April, Mom was admitted. We are both scared. But trust the doctors and process. They won't operate till the patient's reports doesn't come okay. And the reports are perfectly fine, like ECG, all blood tests, xray and MRI.

According to department, they will refer your mom. 

My mom is doing perfectly fine. Everything just so worth it. Although it took my mental peace. But worth it! 
Also, I got some really good friends, who are senior residents there. Pursuing MS there. 

Will go for the right knee by next year. This year they operated left knee. That knee used to pain a lot. Definitely, you have to put effort (:

Most importantly, I'm talking about children of Indian immigrants in the States. These kids already feel pressured to fit in by abandoning their culture, but these videos lead it to other children and adults labelling them as disgusting purely on what they have seen on the internet.

I grew up with some Indian kids, all of them at least experienced some form of bullying for how they smelled or what they ate.

Buy beyond 256 GB only if you will store heavy media files or documents which you will use everyday. Otherwise no point in paying apple for more storage. 

You also have an option of buying an external hard disk of 1 or 2 TB and transfer old work related files on that which you just need for record purpose but may not use it daily. In such a case even 128 GB iPad should work.

Let me tell you, it's not just the stuff they aren't afraid of saying behind the anonymity of alt accounts on insta. These kids say some of what you've mentioned right out in public, in full earshot of their teachers too.

I wouldn't bore you with the details of what I've heard passing by in corridors or what I've heard directly being spoken with me present. But it's definitely not nice. I get it, we were edgy when we were their age too. We've all said mean things and maybe some of us went through a phase of bullying others, punching down etc. But this is different.

Kids now are unafraid of their parents' authority, they're unaffected by scolding, harsh encounters, they don't care if someone tries to correct them. Social media and their peers have created an echo chamber where they feel they're always right. This level of unwillingness to change is unlike anything we've ever seen across young people. Generally, younger people are more willing to change. This doesn't seem to be the case now.

We do not work towards bettering the lives of only the rich, we work towards bettering the lives of everyone. Governance is not a subscription service and income tax is not the subscription fee.

Rather than ask why the poor are getting hand outs. Ask why only the poor are getting handouts outs or why are we still in a state where we have to give handouts to the poor. Why have it not eradicated poverty, why are there still folks who can't seem to find jobs or the education required for it. Why does everyone seem only be able to do manual labour.

1o6ch61,The harsh truth about being middle class in India,njfl2zz,"\> At the same time, the government proudly gives away free flats and free ration to crores of people. Eighty crore citizens out of 140 crore still depend on government ration. If more than half the country still needs free food to survive, what kind of development are we really talking about?

  
I dont disagree with most of the things you said but I dont think 80 crore people ""depend"" on the govt ration to survive. Around 10-20 crore ""survive"" on it. But for the rest, it is mainly about providing them with food so that their money can be better utilised for education or health or other expense.

Even a person earning 50,000 per month, if they come under the criteria for receiving ration in their state, can go and get free/ cheap ration.

\> The government should focus on creating real opportunities like jobs, skill development, and small business support so that people can earn their homes with dignity.

I don't sympathise with the people in this case. It is the people that vote for freebies. It is the people that vote based on caste/ religion without looking at the work they will do. 

Free flats is also majorly given to poor people btw. Their previous generations might have encroached govt land somewhere. Those govts, inorder to save their vote bank, supported them. They have now been living in the encroached land for generations. The govt now has to provide them with alternate housing IF they plan on demolishing the encroached sections. 

I also have conflicting opinions in this case. People do deserve a roof over their head. That is a basic thing. So we can't really deny people free flats. 

\> These endless freebies don‚Äôt help anyone in the long run. They create dependency and kill motivation. Meanwhile, the middle class quietly carries the weight of the entire system.

I dont think the 50,000 per month earning dude is carrying the weight as much as someone who is earning just above 1 lakh per month, because they are also paying income tax in addition to the indirect taxes. Despite paying such high taxes, they dont get anything comparable in return. That's the general consensus I've seen on the internet.

The 50,000 per month earning dude is contributing a lot via indirect taxes, and in return, he is getting free/ cheap ration, subsidised travel on trains, EWS reservation (or the other kind of reservation) for govt stuff. But this is definitely not enough. We can and need to do more. If we can provide good quality public transport everywhere, that itself would be an amazing achievement and would help thousands of people.

This might be controversial but I want more central govt stuff in every state to COMPETE with the state govt's services so that the states do better. Simply letting states do things is letting corruption creep in and the entire country will not care about it because everyone will be like ""It is <xyz> state's problem. Not ours"". However if central govt is more directly involved as a competitor providing better services for the same/ lesser prices, the entire country would be more keen to follow the progress and try to expose corruption in those. It would also motivate the state govts to step up their service quality if they want to win elections in the future.

A simple example would be police: 

I want a central govt directly run police stations in every district, which is run by ex-Agniveers. There we can provide proper body cams for everyone and have a professional parallel police system that is able to step in and help people when the corrupt local police fucks everyone up. Since everything is monitored 24x7 through body cams, they should be less inclined to be against people. 

One more use case would be central govt run public transport system in every state competing with the local state govt buses. Atleast they can provide clean buses on more routes and would help solve our traffic woes to an extent.",13,Positive

think of it like this if you can punish a corrupt politician by approaching the indian Judiciary (if you have the evidence against him) and verdict comes within 6 months - 1 year ( as early as possible).then justice is served 

(now think of this with the current court scenario it will take more than 5 years minimum )

now think in both criminal and civil cases (some divorce cases continue for more than 20 years)

chatgpt generated examples:-""

One notable example is the Aadhaar case, which took over five years for the Supreme Court to resolve (from 2012 to 2017), despite the case having broad national implications. The delays were attributed to the complexities of the case and the sheer volume of cases before the court.


Another example is the 2G Spectrum Scam case, which has been pending in the courts for over a decade, despite its high-profile nature and implications for the telecom industry. The trial in this case has faced significant delays, with various adjournments and prolonged legal proceedings.  ""

The reason for the middle class struggle are not the people who depend on the government but rather the government itself. Poor people are not your enemy, Access to food, house and education are basic necessities every people need, providing assistance to those in need is not a wrong thing, investing on poorer parts of the population through education will give them the opportunity for a better life than they currently have, but these things don't happen overnight, they take time and also passion and dedication from the people who are taking. 

These houses that they give to live are not lavish 3bhks with luxury facilities, they are basic homes. A engineer with access to a stable salary have a potency to go for a little lavish styles in building their homes. 

The lack of opportunities in the job sector is because of the governments shortcomings in building up the future model of our country, (I am not in the tech world but I am only speaking from my personal experience in my field)

I recently read the some report where increasing 1perct of tax on the wealthy people in India and bring in more than 20 perct of the taxes the rest of the india pays to government. But things like this won't happen as the rich enjoy tax relief benefits. It's always the middle class people who are taxed to death. 

So a little kindness to people who don't have access to basic necessities is humanity. I didn't come from a super rich family, my father was a daily wage worker and he put me through education via a government school where i studied very hard to become a doctor now without spending any of my father's money and purely from merit.

Once you can't establish a reason with common sense, the question becomes, what is the intention of the protest? Just to gather people in huge number without a plan and cause a disaster?

So, now what? A bunch of people died in these ""protests"", now again you can whine about how India has no law and order, police should have arranged protection, police shouldn't have allowed it without approval and the whole blame game?

Its really problematic if they have no underlying reason to go at places and show that I love Ram or I love Mohammad.

Understood?

Whereas a guy does not have the choice to say ‚ÄúNo‚Äù to alimony. He has to give it under court rules. Even if he found out the girl is cheating, or has a child with another man, the husband is FORCED to pay alimony for both the wife and her child with other man. He has to pay for both. The Hon‚Äôble court says so.

So all you feminists cry for something that has been spoken a million times, a law being passed to protect women from dowry harassment, to protect women from an ill fated life after divorce, etc.

Where is the law to protect men from false cases or domestic violence by wife & her family? FYI, 80% of all dowry cases are found to be fake with proofs. The remaining 20% does not have enough evidence to prove it is fake (since guilty until proven innocent, even this 20% might come down to 10-5%. So probably 90% of dowry cases might be false). Let that sink in. A few men have already ended their lives, but still no one wants to talk about this. No law has been passed even to prevent false cases let alone punish the false case filers by treating them as criminals (which they are), because they not only put an innocent‚Äôs life in danger but also lie in front of the court.

But‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. even after a women files a false case, lie in front of the court, she is set free. Oh and she is also rightfully entitled for alimony even after doing this.

1o79ull,Convincing Indian parents to eat healthy and exercise,njm8k93,"Try replacing instead of eliminating. Instead of saying ""eat less rice"" or ""eat one less roti"", recommend something like ""use this multigrain atta for your rotis"" or ""instead of having all your rice with dal, have some with this curry (veggies/meat with gravy)"". The idea is that they can continue to serve themselves the same volume, but the meal becomes more balanced. They may even find themselves feeling fuller than before. Multigrain attas tend to have more fibre, and curries are heavier than dal, which would naturally encourage them to eat smaller portions. Of course, this isn't foolproof. But once they see that something you recommended works, they may be more open to seeing a professional who can come up with a proper plan for them.

Edit to add: you can also try something like using smaller plates or suggesting that they eat a salad before their usual rice/roti. But I do find that indian parents respond better when you meet them where they are instead of pushing ""western fad diets"" on them.

For dinner, make sure to always have a protein source that provides at least ~10g protein, with dal or curd or a bit of both. Eat one roti with ghee, two without. Nothing unfamiliar is added, nothing is eliminated.

Long story short, dal is a source of protein, but not a good one. You'll need to either have a lot of it or make it very thick for it to be useful. Both of those are tricky for older people who naturally have smaller appetites than younger people like us. I'd argue their protein needs are higher too since muscle loss comes naturally with age.

Still, I do agree that dal is a source of protein especially with rice, which is why I'm not asking my parents to eliminate it. I'm just saying that instead of having 1 bowl of dal, have half a bowl of dal and let the other half be something with more protein per unit volume.",1,Negative

Indian apps are shit and will never take off until they innovate. E2EE is useless if a cop can just slap you and take your phone to read your texts, but it's the bare minimum expected of an app in 2025. Indian govt wants to spy on VPN users as well which is why Proton has been having a hard time recently. They'll keep invading our privacy in the name of security which the Supreme Court has confirmed is our right, and there's nothing we can do. The least you can do is not send your chats directly to some semi educated fool behind a desk who thinks dissing the govt in power is dissing Bharat mata (ki jai). I don't even talk politics much in chats, but I do expect what I say to not go directly to Modi.

Now that the founder is completely and wholly in bed with the govt in power, I'd prefer to be skeptical until it's completely fleshed out.

Thermal power plants located on the coast have been using this cooling technique for decades.
